This study investigates how chronic social defeat \nstress (CSDS) orchestrates brain-body interactions via the meningeal lymphatic system, driving \nneuroinflammation and potentially contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders. We focused on the \ninterplay between stress-induced alterations in meningeal lymphatic drainage to deep cervical lymph \nnodes (dCLNs), subsequent peripheral immune activation, and the feedback loop involving brain-reactive \nIgG. Using lymphatic tracer assays in mice, we discovered that CSDS significantly enhances antigen \ndrainage from the meninges to dCLNs, indicating altered lymphatic function as a key brain-to-body \ncommunication pathway under stress. This enhanced drainage correlated with heightened B cell \nactivation within dCLNs, signifying a peripheral immune response initiated by CNS-derived signals. \nExamining the brain side of this interaction, we observed robust immune activation within the meninges \nof stress-susceptible mice, including increased activated CD4+ T cells (CD44+CD62L-, CD69+) and \nenhanced antigen presentation capacity by MHCII-expressing macrophages. Critically, this meningeal \ninflammation was associated with increased accumulation of IgG within the brain parenchyma, \nspecifically localized between endothelial cells (CD31) and astrocyte end-feet (AQP4), suggesting IgG \ncrosses the blood-brain barrier. Functional validation using FcRn knockout mice, deficient in IgG \nrecycling, revealed attenuated neuroinflammatory responses and reduced anxiety-like behaviors following \nCSDS, confirming a pathogenic role for this body-to-brain IgG feedback. Our findings delineate a novel \nbrain-body interaction pathway where chronic stress alters meningeal lymphatic function, triggering \nperipheral immune activation (dCLN) which, in turn, promotes brain IgG accumulation and meningeal \ninflammation, creating a vicious cycle.

To understand the\nreconstructed connectome and integrate it with functional interrogation, it is\nindispensable to identify neuronal types in EM datasets. Among the vast array of\nneuronal types, diverse evolutionarily-conserved neuromodulatory (NM) neurons endow\nthe hardwired brain architecture with flexible neural processing and function. Here, we\npresent Fish-X, a synapse-level, multiplexed NM-type-annotated reconstruction\nspanning the retina, brain and anterior spinal cord (SC) of a 6-day-old larval zebrafish,\ncapturing >176,000 cells and >25 million synapses in the brain and SC. Among diverse\nneuronal types, NM (including noradrenergic (NE), dopaminergic (DA), serotonergic\n(5HT), and hypocretinergic (Hcrt)) and glycinergic neurons are identified via\nsubcellular localization of the enhanced ascorbate peroxidase-2, while excitatory (E)\nglutamatergic and inhibitory (I) GABAergic neurons are inferred through morphology\ncomparison with the Zebrafish Mesoscopic Atlas. Different types of NM neurons display\nvarious synapse density and number on dendrites, with the number being positively\ncorrelated with their total projection length. By reconstructing presynaptic neurons\n(PNs) and identifying their E/I identity, in-depth analysis of individual locus coeruleus\n(LC)-NE neurons revealed that they receive brain-wide synaptic inputs, which are\norganized into modality- and E/I-dependent spatial patterns along dendrites. Moreover,\na subset of PNs innervate multiple LC-NE neurons, and this input sharing extends\nacross NE, DA, and 5HT systems, suggesting a co-innervation mechanism for\ncoordinated modulation within and across diverse NM systems. Thus, our study reveals\nthe multi-dimensional synaptic input organization of the LC-NE system.

This interpersonal motor synchrony is linked to social and affective processes, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Since such synchrony arises through real-time interactions, a multi-brain approach is essential. However, analyzing brain activity between two individuals introduces a multiple comparisons problem. To address this, we leveraged a machine learning approach - connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) - to interbrain analysis, which identifies behaviorally relevant brain connectivity without extensive multiple comparisons. Methods We conducted hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging on 27 pairs of participants performing rhythmic hand movements. Each participant's movement was projected to their partner via video system, enabling mutual observation. The phase relationship between their movements and functional connectivity matrix of interbrain were used as input variables for CPM. Results As expected, participants synchronized their movements during real-time interaction. The CPM analysis revealed that interpersonal synchrony in real-time interactions was predicted by connectivity within an interbrain network involving the mirror system. Conclusion This study provides new insights into the neural basis of interpersonal motor synchrony and demonstrates that CPM is a powerful tool for interbrain analysis.

In the CA1 region, somatostatin-expressing (SST) \ninterneurons target pyramidal cell dendrites and  in vitro  these SST+ cells have been shown to \nsimultaneously inhibit distal dendrites but disinhibit proximal dendrites in CA1 pyramidal neurons, \nsuggesting a complex role in modulating principal cell activity during memory encoding.

Results We observed that DREADD-mediated \nactivation of SST+ neurons during training in the trace fear conditioning (TFC) task resulted in \nenhanced memory 1 week later and an increase in the size of the CA1 engram, while SST+ neuron \ninhibition decreased bo th memory and engram size. Ca lcium imaging anal ysis found that \npyramidal cells exhibited higher firing rates, gr eater number of place fields, and less spatially \nselective fields in the SST activation compared to inhibi tion and mCherry control groups, \nsuggesting a more generalized encoding of memory during TFC. Conversely, the SST inhibition \ngroup exhibited more spatially selective, and thus less out-of-field activity than both the activation \nand control groups. This led us to the predictio n that spatial coding ma y be enhanced in SST \ninhibition mice compared to SST activation, whic h was subsequently confirmed in an object \nlocation task (OLT) experiment.

However,\nneural control of palatable food intake is poorly understood. We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by\na neural pathway from the peri-locus coeruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-\ncalibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (DA) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally\nregulate hedonic food consumption. VTADA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by\nsemaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist anti-obesity drug. Mice recovered palatable\nfood appetite and VTADA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by\nconsumption-triggered VTADA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTADA neurons, which\nsustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.\nKeywords: Hedonic eating; VTADA neurons;GLP-1R;", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25081313474681.pdf"}, {"title": "Empathy: concept, behavioral models and neural mechanisms", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Empathy in Large Language Models", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Empathy, Intergroup Bias, and Human-AI Society", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "New generation of animal models for empathy", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "The different regulatory effect of oxytocin in somatic pain and affective pain", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Inter-individual differences in social transfer of allodynia in mice", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "PVN-ACC-BLA Circuit Regulates Empathic Pain and Therapeutic Effects", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Interpersonal Brain Synchrony in Social Pain Empathy and Its Modulation by Oxytocin", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Targeting DAT1 for Treating Social Transmission of Depression", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "The different roles of empathy in heroic behaviors between men and women", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "MeA OXTR neurons projecting to AI and VMHvl regulate consolation and aggression respectively", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Distinct oxytocin signaling pathways synergistically mediate rescue-like behavior in mice", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Neural Control of Helping Behavior by the Anterior Cingulate Cortex", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Long-term Peer Social Relationships in Rats", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Neural mechanism for sociability, social fear and prosocial behavior", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "From vibrations in the ear to abstractions in the brain", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Research on Neural Stem Cells and Brain Development Mechanisms/神经干细胞及脑发育机制研究", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "The interhemispheric amygdala-accumbens circuit encodes negative valence", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "GSDMD Fans the Flame of Inflammatory BBB Breakdown", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Brain-Inspired Perception and Computing/类脑感知与计算", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Construction of Human Dorsal Root Ganglion Organoids to Establish a New Platform for Studying Human Pain and Itch Sensation/构建人类背根神经节类器官建立人类痛痒感觉研究新平台", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Astrocytic H2O2 as the pain-causing molecule in the neuropathic pain model", "text": "Title: Astrocytic H2O2 as the pain-causing molecule in the neuropathic pain \nmodel \nAuthors: Song-I Kim1,2,4, †, Sun Yeul Lee2, *, Dong Woon Kim3, *, C.

He re, we demonstrate that H ₂O₂ \ndirectly induces glial activation and neuronal sensitization in the spinal cord following \nperipheral nerve injury, leading to sustained pain hypersensitivity. Together, H₂O₂ also disrupts \ncircadian regulation by downregulat ing the expression of a transcri ptional repressor in spinal \nglia. This reduction leads to the disinhibition of monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), resulting in \naberrant upregulation of MAOB and excessive production of H₂O₂, especially during the night. \nThe amplified MAOB activity forms a self-reinf orcing feedback loop that accelerates ROS \naccumulation and exacerbates nocturnal pa in. Treatment with KDS12025, a BBB-permeable \nROS scavenger, restores the transcriptional repressor expression, reduces MAOB activity, and \nalleviates both basal and nocturnal pain hypersen sitivity in a spinal nerve transection model. \nThese findings uncover a novel oxidative–cir cadian mechanism of neuropathic pain and \nhighlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the H₂O₂–MAOB pathway with KDS12025.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051521042215.pdf"}, {"title": "Tonic excitation by astrocytic GABA causes neuropathic pain", "text": "Tonic excitation by astrocytic GABA causes neuropathic pain  \nYeon Ha Ju1#, Jongwook Cho2#, Heesu Na1#, Ji-Young Park2, Hyunjin Kim1, \nEun-Bin Hong1, C.

Using \nmultiple electrophysiological methods, we demonstrate that th e neuronal  \nhyperexcitability is attributed to both increased astrocytic GABA synthesis via \nmonoamine oxidase B (MAOB) and depolarized reversal potential of GABA-mediated \ncurrents (EGABA) through decreased neuronal K+/Cl- co-transporter KCC2 expression. \nFurthermore, l ongitudinal 2 -deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose microPET  imaging \ndemonstrates the increased regional glucose metabolism in the ipsilateral dorsal horn, \nreflecting neuronal hyperexcitability. Importantly, inhibiting MAOB re stores the entire \nastrocytic GABA -mediated cascade,  including increased glucose metabolism and \nmechanical allodynia. Additionally, we demonstrate an astrocyte-mediated mechanism \nthat maintains the balance between tonic excitation and inhibition, focusing on the \nmolecular regulation of glutamate and GABA synthesis.

For some devastating patients, a local injury can lead to full -blown \nbody-wise pain that lasts for long time, whereas for most patients the pain could be short-lasting or \nconfined to the unilateral side. Previous studies have supported the role of microgli a for certain \ntypes of chronic pain development. However, the role of microglia in the laterality control of \nmechanical allodynia  remains unsolved. Methods Here, to study the role of microglia in the \nlaterality control of MA, we used genetic strategies to deplete microglia and tested both dynamic \nand punctate forms of MA in mice. Results Surprisingly, the depletion of central microglia did not \nprevent the induction of bilateral dynamic and punctate MA. Moreover, we performed dorsal root \nganglion-dorsal roots-sagittal spinal cord slice preparation s and recorded low threshold Aβ -fiber \nstimulation-evoked inputs and outputs in the superficial dorsal horn neu rons.

Methods: NP was induced in mice using the chronic constriction injury (CCI)\nmodel. Pain sensitivity was assessed using von Frey and thermal assays. Myelin integrity and\noligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cell populations in the spinal cord were evaluated using electron\nmicroscopy and immunohistochemistry.

Results: CCI induced demyelination in the spinal dorsal horn, reduced\nOLs numbers, and impaired OPCs differentiation. A two-pore domain K+ channel (K2P)\nwas found to be enriched in OPCs but significantly downregulated following CCI. OPC-specific\ndeletion of the K2P exacerbated both demyelination and hyperalgesia, whereas AAV-mediated\noverexpression in OPCs promoted remyelination and alleviated pain. Furthermore, chronic\nactivation of Vglut2⁺ excitatory neurons induced persistent pain accompanied by progressive\ndemyelination, with pain onset preceding myelin loss.\nConclusion: Neuropathic pain induces myelin loss in the spinal dorsal horn.

Recent studies have implicated immune activation, particularly via\nToll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of neuropathic\npain. In this study, we examined the role of TLR9 expressed in satellite glial cells\n(SGCs) within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in PTX-induced CINP. Our data\nrevealed a significant upregulation of TLR9 expression in SGCs following PTX\ntreatment. TLR9 activation led to decreased transcription of Kir4.1 (potassium\ninwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 10), a key potassium channel that\nmodulates neuronal excitability. This regulatory process involved histone methylation,\nspecifically mediated by the methyltransferase G9a and activation of the NF-κB\nsignaling pathway. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of\nTLR9 markedly alleviated PTX-induced pain behaviors, while G9a inhibition restored\nKir4.1 expression and reduced neuropathic pain symptoms. These findings underscore\nthe essential role of TLR9 and its downstream effectors, including G9a-mediated\nhistone modification, in CINP pathogenesis.

In population-coding networks (PCNs), this variation enables information to be encoded by the collective activity of the neuronal population rather than by individual neurons. However, how such functionally similar neurons generate quantitatively distinct responses remains unclear. Using Drosophila, we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the assembly of a PCN that encodes nociceptive stimulus intensity in the central nervous system. We found that subpopulations of neurons respond selectively to low- or high-intensity sensory inputs. This quantitative difference in neural encoding arises from intrinsic differences in excitability rather than synaptic connectivity. We show that this excitability gradient is established by gradients of a transcription factor family that regulates ion channel expression. These findings reveal a mechanistic link between transcription factor gradients and sensory intensity encoding via neuronal excitability. More broadly, this work provides insight into how neural networks are organized to optimize response dynamics and suggests that similar transcriptional mechanisms may underlie population coding across sensory systems and species.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25050510033042.pdf"}, {"title": "Decoding A Tiny Vertebrate Brain", "text": "Decoding A Tiny Vertebrate Brain \nJiu-lin Du1,2,3* \n \n1 Institute of Neuroscience, State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Center for Excellence in Brain \nScience and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China. \n2 School of Future Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19A Yu-Quan Road, \nBeijing 100049, China. \n3School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 200031, China. \nEmail: forestdu@ion.ac.cn \n \nAbstract: The brain is a complex dynamic system with highly nonlinear interactions across temporal \nand spatial scales.

In face with the fluctuation of O2\nlevels, animals need to balance energy acquisition and expenditure through behavioral\nand physiological adaptations, eg. increased breathing and less locomotion during\nhypoxic environment. However, the full implementation of such life-critical “hypoxia-\ncoping behavior” is unknown. Here, in young zebrafish, we identified the full neural\ncontroller of hypoxia-coping behavior, which detects and transforms currently-measured\noxygen levels, and predicted future changes therein based on planned oxygen-\nconsuming behavior, into adaptive behavioral and respiratory changes. The\nnoradrenergic nucleus takes in measurements of current intracranial hypoxia, combines\nthis through mutual amplifying effects with motor efference copies, and, through\nsubsequent temporal-filtering action by astrocytes, generates predictions of future self-\ngenerated hypoxia. We furthermore show that, remarkably, the noradrenergic neurons\ndirectly detect brain tissue oxygen levels without relying on peripheral sensors, and that\nin the absence of noradrenergic or astroglial activity, fish behavior becomes almost\nentirely insensitive to oxygen levels. Thus, a century after the discovery of peripheral\noxygen sensors, these results explain hypoxia-coping behavior, critical to the survival of\nmany animals, by identifying the biological implementation of the hypoxia-coping control\nalgorithm.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25052614463850.pdf"}, {"title": "Circulatory factors record brain aging and function", "text": "Circulatory factors record brain aging and function Tony Wyss-Coray, Ph.D. D.

Its intracellular C -terminus \ncontains a functional serine/threonine α-kinase domain (M7CK). In the mammalian brain, \nwe discovered that TRPM7 regulates synaptic density and plasticity as well as learning and \nmemory ability. These effects do not depend on the ion channel domain, or magnesium or \nzinc homeostasis, which appeared to be unaffected by the knockdown, blockade, or \ndeletion of TRPM7 in neural systems both in vitro and in vivo. Instead, the enzymatic \nactivity and expression of M7CK alone was sufficient to rescue synaptic and cognitive \nfunctions. \nIn hippocampal tissue samples obtained from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, we found \nthat TRPM7 expression was reduced. We also found that the kinase activity of TRPM7 and \nexpression were decreased in the hippocampus of two mouse models of AD (APP/PS1 and \n5XFAD). In cultures of hippocampal neurons from mice, overexpression of full -length \nTRPM7 or M7CK prevented synapse loss induced by exogenous Aβ. In contrast, this \nneuroprotection was not afforded by overexpression of either the functional ion channel \nportion alone or a TRPM7 mutant lacking kinase activity.

Genetically encoded indicators built from fluorescent proteins have been especially useful, but they have a fixed emission color, and we currently lack bright indicators in the near infrared. Chemigenetic indicators, built from genetically encoded proteins and bright small-molecule dye-ligands, allow flexibility in the emission color.

We have used WHaloCaMP with near-infrared emission to image neuronal activity in the brains of living animals, and we have performed simultaneous three-color functional imaging in zebrafish larvae together with green and red indicators. As WHaloCaMP has >2 ns change in fluorescence lifetime on calcium addition, we also performed quantitative fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of calcium ion transients in cells and in zebrafish larvae.

The gut-origin hypothesis\nof PD proposes that constipation may reflect α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation in enteric neurons,\nrepresenting a critical peripheral pathogenic mechanism. While recent studies have experimentally validated\nthe dissemination of intestinal α-Syn aggregates, the precise neural pathways mediating their propagation to\nthe brain and the specificity of involved neurons remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the neural\ncircuits linking gut-derived α-Syn pathology to central neurodegeneration and explore therapeutic\ninterventions targeting this pathway. Methods: A novel mouse model of gut-derived α-Syn pathology was\ndeveloped to simulate PD progression. Viral tracing techniques were employed to map neural connections\nbetween the colonic plexus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV)/nucleus tractus solitarius\n(NTS). In vivo calcium imaging and chemogenetic approaches were used to assess cholinergic neuron\nactivity in the DMV of A53T transgenic mice with chronic constipation. Electroacupuncture stimulation at\nthe ST25 acupoint (Tianshu) was administered for 20 consecutive days, with concurrent evaluation of gut\nmicrobiome composition, intestinal mucosal integrity, and neuronal excitability. Results: Intestinal α-Syn\naggregates propagated via vagal afferents to the DMV and NTS, triggering PD-related motor and non-motor\nsymptoms. Cholinergic neurons in the DMV received direct projections from colonic ganglia, showing\nreduced activity in constipated A53T mice. Chemogenetic activation of DMV cholinergic neurons alleviated\nconstipation and slowed α-Syn dissemination, while inhibition accelerated pathology. Electroacupuncture at\nST25 significantly improved constipation symptoms, restored gut microbial diversity, enhanced intestinal\nepithelial integrity, and upregulated Chat+ neuronal excitability in the DMV, mirroring direct cholinergic\nneuron activation. Conclusion: This study mechanistically links gut-derived α-Syn pathology to central\nneurodegeneration through the vagus nerve-cholinergic axis, identifying DMV cholinergic neurons as\ncritical regulators of PD progression.

Abstract Brain aging is a critical pathogenic factor for various brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the mechanisms of brain aging and related diseases are still unclear. Our group reported that mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by glutaminase (Gls) occurred prior to the emergence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) related pathogenesis in the brains of AD mice, leading to inﬂammatory reactions of microglia and the release of pathological extracellular vesicles, which resulted in the formation of neuroinﬂammatory microenvironment. The hyperaction of Gls in microglia in mouse brain leads to excessive synaptic construction and inﬂammatory response, causing damage to neural structure and function, and cognitive decline. Interestingly, inhibiting Gls activation can signiﬁcantly rescue the mitochondrial metabolic imbalance in microglia and alleviate cognative decline in AD mice.

The subthalamic nucleus \n(STN), a central structure within the basal ganglia responsible for motor control, \nis one of the most targeted sites for DBS in PD. For therapeutic efficacy, DBS \nmust be applied at higher frequencies such as 130 Hz, whereas frequencies \nbelow 60 Hz can exacerbate PD symptoms. The mechanisms underlying this \nfrequency-dependent DBS modulation remain unclear, and a deeper \nunderstanding could enhance the clinical application of DBS. Given that DBS \npredominantly affects neurites, particularly axons, and that high- frequency \nstimulation (HFS) induces asynchronous release (AR) of neurotransmitters, we \nhypothesize that AR may desynchronize the spiking activity of STN neurons \nand thereby alleviate Parkinsonian motor deficits. Our findings support this \nhypothesis: 1) HFS induces both synchronous release (S R) and AR initially, \nwith AR becoming dominant several seconds after the stimulation onset, while \nlow-frequency stimulation (LFS) predominantly triggers SR throughout the \nstimulation period. 2) GABAergic, rather than glutamatergic, synaptic \ntransmission is  crucial for the therapeutic effects of high- frequency DBS. 3) \nActivation of GABAergic axons from parvalbumin (PV) neurons in the external \nglobus pallidus (GPe) desynchronizes firing of STN neurons, and activation of \nPV axons at STN is both necessary and s ufficient for the beneficial effects of \nDBS. 4) LFS can also produce therapeutic outcomes if the AR strength from \nPV axons is enhanced through genetic manipulation. Collectively, our results \nunderscore the pivotal role of GABA AR from GPe PV neurons in mediating the \nbenefits of high- frequency DBS, highlighting AR as a potential biomarker for \noptimizing DBS parameters in future studies. \nKeywords: Deep brain stimulation, Subthalamic nucleus, synapse, \nasynchronous release, Parkinson's disease", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051422464523.pdf"}, {"title": "Astrocytic calcium prevents synaptic depotentiation by limiting repetitive activity in dendrites during motor learning", "text": "Astrocytic Ca2+ prevents synaptic depotentiation by limiting repetitive activity in\ndendrites during motor learning\nBaoling Lai, Deliang Yuan, Zhiwei Xu, Feilong Zhang, Ming Li, Alejandro Martín-Ávila, Xufeng Chen, Kai Chen, Kunfu\nOuyang, Guang Yang, Moses Chao, Wen-Biao Gan\nAffiliation：Shenzhen Bay Laboratory\nAbstract\nMany lines of evidence indicate that astrocytic Ca2+ activity regulates activity-dependent\nsynaptic plasticity, but its role in learning-related synaptic changes in the living brain remains\nunclear.

However, challenges persist in terms of low\ndiagnostic efficiency, poor treatment outcomes, and an inability to meet the substantial demand for\nmedical services. With advancements in information and communication technologies,\nsoftware-driven cognitive digital therapeutics have emerged as novel approaches for providing\nevidence-based digital cognitive assessment, intervention, and management for patients. Digital\ncognitive assessments include electronic scales, task-based evaluations, and neurophysiological\nassessments. Compared to traditional assessment methods, digital cognitive assessment allows for\nreal-time monitoring of cognitive changes, offering a more comprehensive and detailed evaluation\nwith good sensitivity and specificity. Digital cognitive assessments based on cognitive\nneuroscience and non-invasive brain-machine interface technologies enable rapid, accurate, and\nearly screening of cognitive functions. Integrating digital cognitive assessment with artificial\nintelligence-based virtual doctors can significantly reduce human resource cost and promote\ncognitive screening in primary healthcare institutions and communities. Digital cognitive\ninterventions encompass computerized cognitive training, neurostimulation, and interventions\ntargeting risk factors of cognitive impairment. Computerized cognitive training based on neural\nplasticity can target specific cognitive domains, improving overall cognitive function and abilities\nof daily living. Neurostimulation techniques, including transcranial electrical stimulation,\nmagnetic stimulation, and focused ultrasound stimulation, have also been shown to enhance\ncognitive functions. Interventions targeting cognitive impairment-related risk factors, when\ncombined with cognitive training, can enhance executive functions, processing speed, and overall\ncognitive abilities, achieving the goal of comprehensive intervention. Digital cognitive\nmanagement enables real-time monitoring and acquisition of objective, quantifiable physiological\nand behavioral data. It allows for the monitoring and analysis of changes in cognitive function,\nabilities of daily living, and treatment efficacy. This assists patients with cognitive impairment in\nmanaging daily activities, improving life skills, and reducing caregiver burden. Digital\ntherapeutics for cognitive disorders based on digital cognitive assessment, intervention, and\nmanagement is an integral part of the \" Chinese expert consensus on cognitive health management\n(2023)\".

In contrast, significantly less has been discovered using non-human primates, largely due to several limiting factors. In typical laboratory settings, many primate species—especially those with larger body sizes—tend to vocalize less than they would in their natural environments. This limitation has slowed progress in utilizing these species to study neural communication. However, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small-bodied New World primate, has recently gained prominence as a highly promising NHP model system in this field. Marmosets offer several advantages over other non-human primates. They are naturally highly social and possess a diverse repertoire of vocal communication calls. Anatomically, their relatively smooth (lissencephalic) cortex provides easier access to cortical areas, facilitating both electrophysiological and optical recordings. Importantly, the marmoset’s auditory range closely overlaps with that of humans, making it especially suitable for auditory neuroscience.

We now translate this approach to studying epilepsy patients using clinical intracranial electrodes, combined with task fMRI targeting various functional systems such as language, social cognition, and object vision. We made converging findings at dozens of frontotemporal stimulation sites. At a gross level, a site’s functionality dictated its connectivity pattern. A site activated in task fMRI for one system tended to have a connectivity pattern correlated with the latter’s cortex-wide activation maps and anticorrelated with maps for other systems, consistent with the idea of a network of related areas. At the millimeter scale, many connections were indeed within the same system as their stimulation sites. They tended not to span an entire system but varied systematically with the site’s location. We also found numerous connections across systems: some were hierarchical, i.e., between a high-level system and its sensory input, and others were “lateral” and involved similar-level systems, such as language and social cognition, and face and object perception. The within- vs. cross-system ratio didn’t vary much with distance; still, we identified a subset of close-to-mid-distance connections that was highly functionally non-specific.

A given neuron forms synapses with a limited number of partners and on precise subcellular localizations. Each synapse type on a given neuron also obeys precise plasticity rules. Understanding what controls this specificity is mandatory not only to understand brain functions but also the etiology of synaptopathies such as autism spectrum disorders or schizophrenia. Various molecules define the identity of each type of synapse. Furthermore, neuronal activity-dependent mechanisms sculpt and stabilize neuronal connectivity. Our team’s work aims at dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying synapse identity during brain development and function. We focus on the olivocerebellar network, which is involved in motor control and also in cognitive processes. In this well characterized circuit, two different excitatory inputs, the climbing fibres and the parallel fibres converge on the same target, the cerebellar Purkinje cells, compete for their non-overlapping territory and possess distinct functional, morphological and molecular characteristics. Purkinje cells thus provide an ideal model to study the molecular basis of synapse identity and its regulation.

In contrast comprehensive models for affective arousal are lacking, leading to continuing debates of whether the neural systems generalize across valence domains and are separable from those underlying autonomic arousal or wakefulness. The present talk will outline the results of a series of studies combining naturalistic fMRI with predictive modeling to develop a brain affective arousal signature (BAAS, discovery-validation design, n=60, 36), test its sensitivity and generalizability across mental processes characterized by high arousal states ranging from pain to seeing the picture of loved ones and determine its whole-brain neural distinction from autonomic arousal or wakefulness with additional regional models suggesting common regional processing nodes that underly arousal across domains (24 studies, n=885). Affective arousal was encoded in distributed cortical (prefrontal regions, insula) and subcortical (amygdala, PAG) systems.

Hypoxia is a recognized environmental risk factor for\nAD. It has been reported that AD patients experience oxygen metabolism abnormality\nand hypoxia contributes to AD-related pathological changes such as amyloid β (Aβ)\ndeposition and tau phosphorylation.

In our study, we applied a 20-day\nHBOT treatment on AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, following a\nbattery of neuropsychiatric assessments, blood tests of inflammatory factors and\nfluorodeoxyglucose neuroimaging. Our results showed that HBOT improved the\ncognitive scores of MMSE, MoCA, and ADAS-cog in AD and MCI patients at\n1-month and 3-month follow-up, along with a significantly reduced blood level of\ninterleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α and an improvement of brain glucose\nmetabolism. Furthermore, we applied a 3-month HBOT intervention on 3-month-old\nAPP/PS1 AD mice and measured the cognitive function and AD-related pathological\nchanges at 9-month-old. We found that HBOT reduced Aβ plaques deposition,\nhyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregation, and neuronal and synaptic degeneration\nand attenuated impairments of cognitive function. HBOT also enhanced blood oxygen\nsaturation level and improved vascular structure and function, and reduced\nneuroinflammation in AD mice. As a non-pharmacological therapy, HBOT has the\nadvantages of lower cost and fewer side effects.

Growing evidence suggests that hypoxia is closely linked to an increased\nrisk of AD. Vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4), a critical regulator of hypoxia-sensitive\npathways, is highly responsive to hypoxic conditions and plays a role in metabolic adaptation.\nHowever, the pathological association between VGLL4 and AD has not been reported yet. This\nstudy aimed to investigate the role and regulatory mechanisms of VGLL4 in AD. Methods A\ncombination of behavioral analyses, electrophysiological recordings, single-cell sequencing, gene\nmanipulation, and molecular biology techniques was employed to comprehensively examine the\nrole and potential mechanisms of VGLL4 in AD at both in vivo and in vitro levels. Results (1)\nVGLL4 protein expression was significantly reduced in AD model mice and cells.

Regrettably, there are currently no efficacious etiological treatments available. Hypoxic conditioning is a crucial approach for countering ischemia and hypoxia, as it has the capacity to trigger the body's endogenous self-protective mechanisms. Among these, intermittent hypoxia is a crucial way to achieve hypoxic conditioning. We found that IH can effectively improve the cerebral microvascular network by promoting angiogenesis. The newly formed vessels have well-structured blood-brain barrier and contribute to the enhancement of cerebral blood flow. To investigate the effects of IH on VCID, we established a VCID mouse model through bilateral carotid artery stenosis. IH treatment was administered before or after the stenosis. Intriguingly, we observed that IH significantly increased cerebral blood flow and oxygen saturation levels, and improved microcirculation in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus regions, all without inducing any neurovascular damage. Furthermore, IH demonstrated a remarkable ability to improve cognitive function in VCID mice. Notably, IH perconditioning exhibited a more pronounced therapeutic efficacy compared to IH preconditioning. In the clinical context, VCID patients frequently present with comorbidities, such as hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. To mimic this real-world scenario, we established a VCID mouse model with comorbidities induced by a high-fat, high-fructose diet. Our results showed that IH perconditioning continued to exert a robust protective effect on cognitive function even in the presence of comorbidities. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that IH represents a promising, non-invasive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of VCID, offering new hope for the management of this challenging neurological disorder.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051017223576.pdf"}, {"title": "Investigating the transcriptomic landscape of the Phox2a-expressing anterolateral system.", "text": "Investigating the transcriptomic landscape of the Phox2a-expressing\nanterolateral system\nAndrew Bell, University of Glasgow\nThe anterolateral system (ALS) is a major ascending pathway from the spinal cord\nthat projects to multiple brain areas and underlies the perception of pain, itch, and\nskin temperature.

In this\nstudy, we elucidate a novel functional role of the m6A demethylase alkylation repair homolog\n5 (ALKBH5) in modulating trigeminal-mediated neuropathic pain. Peripheral nerve injury\nselectively upregulated the expression level of ALKBH5 in the injured trigeminal ganglion\n(TG) of rats. Blocking this upregulation in injured TGs alleviated trigeminal neuropathic pain,\nwhile mimicking the upregulation of ALKBH5 in intact TG neurons sufficiently induced\npain-related behaviors. Mechanistically, histone deacetylase 11 downregulation induced by\nnerve injury increases histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), facilitating the binding of\nthe transcription factor forkhead box protein D3 (FOXD3) to the Alkbh5 promoter and\npromoting Alkbh5 transcription. The increased ALKBH5 erases m6A sites in Htr3a mRNA,\nresulting in an inability of YT521-B homology domain 2 (YTHDF2) to bind to Htr3a mRNA,\nthus causing an increase in 5-HT3A protein expression and 5-HT3 channel currents.\nConversely, blocking the increased expression of ALKBH5 in the injured TG destabilizes\nnerve injury-induced 5-HT3A upregulation and reverses mechanical allodynia, and the effect\ncan be blocked by 5-HT3A knockdown. Together, FOXD3-mediated transactivation of\nALKBH5 promotes neuropathic pain through m6A-dependent stabilization of Htr3a mRNA\nin TG neurons. This mechanistic understanding may advance the discovery of new\ntherapeutic targets for neuropathic pain management.\nKey words:ALKBH5, neuropathic pain, histone acetylation, N6-methyladenosine, trigeminal\nganglion neurons", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061311313275.pdf"}, {"title": "Interrogating memory using light", "text": "Interrogating memory using light\nMichael Hausser, The University of Hong Kong\nUnderstanding the causal relationship between activity patterns in neural circuits and\nmemory-guided behavior is one of the fundamental questions in neuroscience.

This\nallows animals to build appropriate priors, in order to disambiguate noisy inputs, make\npredictions and act more efficiently. Despite decades of research in the field of human\ncognition and theoretical neuroscience, it is not known how such learning can be\nimplemented in the brain. By combing sophisticated cognitive tasks in humans, rats, and\nmice, as well as neuronal measurements and perturbations in the rodent brain and\ncomputational modelling, we seek to build a multi-level description of how regularities in\ntemporally extended tasks are learned and utilised. In this talk, I will specifically focus on a\ncross-species model to study statistical learning, in both feedback-based and non-feedback-\nbased settings.\nFurther details:\nIn the first part, we compare human, rat, and mouse performance on a two-alternative\nforced-choice sound categorisation task, manipulating stimulus statistics to create distinct\n‘statistical contexts’ without altering category probability. We show that all species develop\nan optimal, context-dependent bias that maximises rewards, as predicted by a normative\nmodel incorporating sensory noise in sound representation. Animals flexibly adapt to shifts in\nprior probabilities without explicit cues, gradually adjusting their psychometric behaviour to\nnew distributions. While all species exhibit similar adaptation at the population level,\nindividual differences emerge in learning speed and trial-to-trial updates. A key question is\nwhether individuals learn the full shape of the sensory distribution (Sensory Priors), or simply\nlearn and adapt a mapping from sensory input to output action (Decision Priors). By\ncontrasting two model classes—boundary learning (akin to Decision Priors) and stimulus-\ncategory learning (akin to Sensory Priors)—we show how both mechanisms support optimal\nuse of sensory statistics. Humans predominantly align with the category model, suggesting\nthat they learn the distributions of both categories separately. Rats exhibit intermediate\nbehaviour, while mice primarily adopt the boundary model, suggesting that they learn only\nthe boundary between categories without representing each category distribution separately.\nIn the second part, we explore the innate capabilities of mice to discern environmental\nregularities, focusing on the role of the hippocampus in this unsupervised learning process.\nThe study leverages a novel comparative behavioural paradigm, termed X-detection, to\nmanipulate the statistics of embedded tone sequences (patterns) in an auditory cover task:\nsubjects should respond to a target sound, X, that appears at a random time. We show pupil\nresponses in mice, similar to our human subjects, track statistics of presented patterns, with\nlimited exposure. Importantly, these embedded patterns were decoupled from the X;\ntherefore, from the reward. Importantly, performance on X-detection was not affected by the\nembedded patterns. This paradigm provides a flexible and robust toolkit for probing\nstatistical learning over a range of sound statistics without reinforcing the learning via reward.\nBilateral inactivation of CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus (dCA1) despite sparing the\nperformance on X-detection, diminished the pupil response tracking the statistics. Finally,\nneural recordings from dCA1 show distinct representations of task-irrelevant stimuli that\nreflect the tracking of the event statistics and learning abstract patterns. To our knowledge,\nthese results provide the first set of evidence, in rodents, for causal role of hippocampus in\nfast statistical learning of sound statistics.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061314254013.pdf"}, {"title": "Neuronal circuit computations underlying flexible rule-switching in decision-making", "text": "Neuronal circuit computations underlying flexible rule-switching in decision-\nmaking\nNinglong Xu, Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology,CAS\nAbstract:\nDecision-making and problem-solving require the ability to flexibly select actions based on rules and\ncontexts in response to sensory inputs.

Two complementary frameworks have emerged in cognitive and neuroscience research: the geometric and algebraic approaches.  The geometric approach suggests that the brain represents relationships between states or concepts in a map-like format, where distances encode similarity or transition costs. This framework is typically employed in tasks requiring global evaluation, such as navigation, where a cognitive map allows for ﬂexible planning and decision-making across spatial or abstract domains.  In contrast, the algebraic approach highlights the brain's ability to encode logical operations and structured sequences. Using primitives, ordinals, and tree-like representations, this approach models step-by-step reasoning and hierarchical planning. It is particularly suited for tasks like hierarchical decision-making, where understanding local relationships and performing sequential evaluations are critical.  In this talk, I will discuss how these two approaches—geometric and algebraic—provide complementary insights into the brain's problem-solving algorithms. Drawing on behavioral and neural data from tasks like Pac-Man and causal inference, I will explore how neural coding strategies may reﬂect these representations and support structured sequence processing across diverse cognitive domains. Additionally, I will examine how these frameworks map onto neural activity, potentially offering a uniﬁed view of problem-solving in the brain.  By integrating these perspectives, we can deepen our understanding of the brain’s algorithmic principles in problem-solving, bridging insights from neuroscience, cognitive science, and artiﬁcial intelligence.

Here, we unveil the critical role of neuroimmune signaling in ALI, focusing on\nthe regulatory function of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular\nnucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Using viral tracing, chemogenetic modulation, and\npharmacological interventions in mouse models of ALI induced by intranasal lipopolysaccharide\nand cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), we found that lung injury activated CRHPVN neurons that\nprojected to the lung. Activation of these neurons protected mice from ALI and death, reducing\nneutrophil infiltration and effector functions in the lung. In contrast, inhibiting CRHPVN neurons\nexacerbated ALI. Notably, the beneficial impact of CRHPVN neuron activation is compromised by\nthe pulmonary chemical sympathectomy or inhibition of the β2-adrenergic receptor. These\nprotective effects were dependent on sympathetic nerves, with norepinephrine released locally to\nmodulate neutrophil functions via β2-AR–β-arrestin2 signaling, inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.\nOur findings reveal a brain-lung axis that regulates immune responses in ALI, suggesting novel\ntherapeutic targets for ALI and ARDS.\nKeywords: acute lung injury; paraventricular nucleus; corticotropin-releasing hormone;\nsympathetic nervous system; neutrophil", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061314313289.pdf"}, {"title": "Glia control of brain lymphatics development", "text": "Glia control of brain lymphatic development \n \nJia Li (李佳) 1,2 # *, Ming-Jian Liu (刘明剑) 3 #, Wen-Jie Du (杜文杰) 4 #, Jiu-Lin Du \n(杜久林)1,2,5* \n \n1 Institute of Neuroscie nce, Key Laboratory of Brain Cognition and Brain -Inspired \nIntelligence Technology, Center  for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence \nTechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China \n2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China \n3 Department of Neurosurgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School \nof Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China \n4 Department of Anesthesiology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai  \n200040, China \n5 School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 200031, \nChina \n* Correspondence: lijia@ion.ac.cn (J.L.), forestdu@ion.ac.cn (J.D.) \n \nABSTRACT \nThe nervous system regulates peripheral immune responses under physiological and \npathological conditions, but the brain’s impact on immune system development remains \nunknown.

Abstract: Neurons are highly polarised cells with distinct cellular compartments such as axons and dendrites. These projections can reach lengths of up to 1 m in humans and 30 m in some species of whale. During development and throughout life, neuronal projections experience mechanical force. Our work, and that of others, has shown that axons can be physically torn apart by shear forces during body movement if conserved protective mechanisms are disrupted. Spectrins are highly conserved molecules that form a distinct membrane associated periodic scaffold within axons to provide mechanical resilience. In C. elegans, UNC-70/ß-Spectrin also functions outside the nervous system, within the epidermis, to maintain the integrity of sensory neurons. The precise molecular organization and cellular mechanisms that mediate this protection are unknown. Here, using 3D-structured illumination microscopy, we show that within the epidermis, SPC-1/a-Spectrin and UNC-70/ß-Spectrin form a crescent-shaped scaffold with a periodicity of ~ 200 nm that embraces adjacent axons. We reveal that this epidermal spectrin scaffold is induced by developing axons and reformed during axonal regeneration, creating a “molecular imprint” of the adjacent nervous system. We demonstrate that disruption of the epidermal scaffold causes axonal damage in neurons. Finally, we provide evidence that the epidermal scaffold protects axons by restricting the endocytosis of cell adhesion molecules necessary to maintain axonal-epidermal adhesion. These findings reveal the existence of a distinct periodic spectrin framework within the epidermis that is molded by the developing nervous system, and that is necessary to protect sensory axons from damage.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25040718421789.pdf"}, {"title": "Brain control of B-cell immunity: an update", "text": "Brain control of B-cell immunity: an update\nHai Qi\nInstitute for Immunology, Tsinghua University\nI will present our findings of central circuits that shape how\nhumoral immune memory is formed and recalled.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25052211040839.pdf"}, {"title": "Dysregulation of astrocyte activity and metabolism mediates glymphatic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease", "text": "Dysregulation of astrocyte activity and metabolism mediates\nglymphatic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in\nAlzheimer’s disease\nZhan Zhang1,2,3, Chuan Xiao3, Yubai Zhao4, Yuting Xia3, Min Zhang5,6, Yuan Luo3, Xiaoru Xie3,\nXiaojing Ye5,6,*, Wei-Jye Lin1,3,6,*, Yamei Tang1,2,6,*\n1Brain Research Center, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou\n510120, China.\n2Department of Neurology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou\n510120, China.\n3Center for Basic and Translational Medicine, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen\nUniversity, Guangzhou 510120, China.\n4Department of Rehabilitation, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou\n510280, China.\n5Faculty of Forensic Medicine, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University,\nGuangzhou 510120, China.\n6Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Disease, Zhongshan School of\nMedicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, China.\n*Corresponding author\nE-mail: tangym@mail.sysu.edu.cn; linwj26@mail.sysu.edu.cn; yexiaoj8@mail.sysu.edu.cn\nAbstract: Objective Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and\nthe most common type of dementia worldwide.

Stress is thus commonly used in animal models for modeling human neuropsychiatric\ndisorders. However, animal models have various limitations, especially their poor predictive power for drug\nefficacy in human diseases. We have been exploring whether anhedonia, one of the core symptoms of\nmajor depressive disorder (MDD), holds predictive power for treatment efficacy in human depression. Here,\nwe report a novel symptom-driven therapeutic approach for depression, which has emerged from our\npreclinical and translational work targeting anhedonia and aberrant activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA)\ndopamine neurons via modulation of the KCNQ subtype of voltage-gated potassium channels. In the\npreclinical study, we showed that KCNQ channel opener, retigabine (ezogabine) inhibits the pathological\nhyperactivity of VTA dopamine neurons in social stress-susceptible mice, accompanied with improvement in\ndeficits of social interaction and sucrose preference, behaviors relevant to anhedonia. In our translational\ninvestigations, individuals with elevated anhedonia and MDD were treated with either ezogabine or placebo.\nThe primary clinical results demonstrated significant improvements in both anhedonia and depression,\nmeasured by clinical scores of SHAPS (Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale), MADRS (Montgomery–Asberg\nDepression Rating Scale), and QIDS (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self Report).\nImportantly, VTA activation in depressed patients during anticipation of the incentive flanker task is\nsignificantly reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine treatment when compared to placebo control. Furthermore,\nthis VTA hyperactivity is associated with higher mesocortical functional connectivity, which is also reduced\nfrom pre-to-post ezogabine compared to placebo in the patients with MDD. These observations are highly\nconsistent with preclinical findings, highlighting the role of VTA hyperactivity in individuals with depression.\nTogether, our symptom-driven treatment from a preclinical model to clinical patients indicates that a\nrepeatedly measurable symptom in rodents may possess good and adequate predicative power, which is\npotentially useful in the research of other psychiatric conditions, including alcohol-use disorders.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061316420771.pdf"}, {"title": "Circuitry and Molecular Mechanisms for Chronic Pain Sensitization", "text": "Circuitry and Molecular Mechanisms for Chronic Pain Sensitization\nXiaoke Chen, Stanford University\nAbstract:\nInflammation or nerve injury at periphery can cause chronic pain.

Addictive substances mediate the transformation of neutral\nenvironmental stimuli into potent conditioned stimuli (CS) through rewarding effects\nand associative learning mechanisms, with visual cues emerging as the most clinically\nsignificant triggers for relapse. The superior colliculus (SC), a critical subcortical hub\nfor sensory-motor integration, processes visual inputs in its superficial layers and\ncoordinating orienting behaviors through multisensory integration in its deep layers.\nAlthough studies indicate that the SC provides minimally processed visual\ninformation to the midbrain reward system—particularly dopamine (DA) neurons in\nthe ventral tegmental area (VTA)—the involvement of the SC-VTA circuit in visual\ncue-induced relapse remains unclear. As the primary projection target of VTA DA\nneurons, the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) plays a pivotal role in processing\nreward-predictive cues. Our previous work has demonstrated the essential\ninvolvement of the VTA-NAcore DA pathway in conditioned visual cue-driven\nrelapse. However, whether the SC, VTA, and NAcore function as an integrated neural\ncircuit to regulate visual cue-induced relapse needs to be fully elucidated. In this study,\nwe employed an integrative approach combining fiber photometry, optogenetics, and\nchemogenetics in methamphetamine (MA) self-administration model to\nsystematically investigate the SC-VTA-NAcore circuit. We found that blockade of the\nSC-VTA pathway significantly attenuated MA-seeking behavior and fiber photometry\nrecordings revealed visual cue-selective activation of both glutamatergic and DA\nneurons in SC-VTA pathway during relapse. Further, bidirectional manipulation\n(inhibition/activation) of the SCGlu+-VTADA+ pathway potently affected relapse\nbehaviors. Finally, retrograde trans-synaptic tracing identified monosynaptic\nSC-VTADA+-NAcore connectivity, whose bidirectional intervention robustly regulated\nvisual cue-induced relapse. Collectively, this study provides the first direct evidence\nfor the critical role of the SCGlu+-VTADA+-NAcore circuit in visual cue-driven drug\nrelapse. These findings significantly advance our understanding of how visual cues\nimpact addictive behaviors and may identify novel therapeutic targets for preventing\nrelapse.\nKeyword: Superior colliculus; Ventral tegmental area; Nucleus accumbens core;\nVisual cues; Relapse", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061316441195.pdf"}, {"title": "Neural circuit and social mechanism of drug addiction", "text": "Neural circuit and social mechanism of drug addiction \n \nYingjie Zhu, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences \n \nDrug addiction is characterized by compulsive drug -seeking behavior despite adverse \nconsequences.

A key question is how these dynamic features arise mechanistically and their relationship to circuit connectivity. In previous work (Hu & Sompolinsky 2022), we proposed to use the covariance eigenvalue distribution, or spectrum, which can be analytically derived in random recurrent networks, as a robust measure for describe the shape of neural population activity beyond the dimension. Applications of the theoretical spectrum have broadly found accurate matching to experimental data across brain areas providing mechanistic insights into the observed low dimensional population dynamics (Morales et al. 2023; Calvo et al., 2024). However, the empirical success highlights a gap in theory where the neural network model used to derive the spectrum was minimal with linear neurons. In this work, we aim to close this gap by studying the covariance spectrum in nonlinear networks and broader dynamical regimes including chaos. Surprisingly, we found that the spectrum can be precisely understood by equations analogous to the linear theory while using an effective connectivity parameter reflecting the nonlinear neurons. Across the dynamical regimes, we found this effective connectivity goes through an increasing and then decreasing trend with the turning point near the edge of chaos. These results further our understanding of nonlinear neural population dynamics and provide additional theoretical support for applying the covariance spectrum in biological circuits.

This assumption of functional\ninsignificanceofweakconnectivity is highly conflictingto thereliableobservations of abundance\nof weak connectivity across mammalian species. Here, we proposed that weak connectivity may\nhave significant functional relevance to human cognitive abilities and brain functions by\namplifying its small weight through a nonlinear manner. In the HCP dataset (n=999), multiple\ntractographyalgorithmswereappliedtoconstructthewhole-brainSCwith heterogeneousweights\nof streamline number. Accounting for the nonlinear functioning manner, weak connectivity that\ninvolves high individual variability, is indispensable in predicting general ability and memory ,\nand it is also crucial to the relationship between brain structural and functional connectivity (FC)\nandthedynamic model simulation ofthe whole-brain FC. Crucially, fusingtwo post-tractography\nfiltering methods of streamlines can obtain potentially more reliable SC, which decreases the\nnetwork density, but meanwhile, keeps the powers of cognitive abilities predictions,\nstructure-function relationship and FC simulation, better than the thresholding method simply\nremoving weak connectivity. Then, we revealed that weak connectivity displays an intersystem\norganization and supports the segregation-integration balance by not only enhancing network\nintegration required by the predicted cognitive abilities, but also promoting finer-scale local\nsegregation. Finally, we identified a category of weak connectivity that links low-order\nvisual/motor to high-order limbic regions with negative gene coexpression (GC). This kind of\nweak connectivity has higher impact on network dynamics and predictions of cognitive abilities\nthan that with positive GC. Our results demonstrate the underrated significance of weak\nconnectivity in human brains and cognitive abilities, provide a novel way to obtain reliable brain\nstructural connectivity containing important individual difference, and contribute to advancing\nnetworkneuroscience.\nKeywords: Human cognitive abilities, brain structural connectome, large-scale dynamic model,\ngeneco-expression", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061316484791.pdf"}, {"title": "Neuronal control of social behaviors", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effect of TRIM72 on ALS disease progression", "text": "Cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effect of TRIM72 on ALS disease progression  Xue Zhang1,3,4,11, Ji He5,11, Ning Song3,4,11, Xipeng Li7, Weizhe Wang2, Yueting Hu2, Qing Li6, Yiqing Hu6, Chunmu Yin3, Peng Zhao1,3,4, Xinyi Jiang3, Xuejiao Piao1,3,4, Dawei Meng1,2,3,4, Hongmei Cheng10, Zhaohui Chen10, Xusheng Huang10, Li Luo9, Lin Peng8, Wei Guo8, Tong Wang6, Haipeng Gong2, Dongsheng Fan5,#, and Yichang Jia1,3,4,8,9#  1 Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences. 2 School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University 3 School of Basic Medical Sciences, Medical Science Building, Room D204, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 100084. 4 IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Tsinghua. 5 Neurological Department of Peking University Third Hospital 6 School of Life Science and Technology, Shanghai Tech University, Shanghai, China.  7 Xingtai People’s Hosptial. 8 SineuGene Therapeutics Co., ltd. 9 Tsinghua Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence. 10 Neurology Department, The First Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital.  11 These authors contributed equally to this work. # Corresponding authors  Abstract:  Dysfunction of RNA-binding proteins, including TDP-43 and FUS, has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we reported that a neuronal upregulation of TRIM72 (Tripartite Motif Containing 72) in FUS mutation knockin ALS models slows disease progression. TRIM72 interacts with Commander, a protein complex for recycling of membrane proteins, facilitating membrane repair and antioxidation. Exosomal TRIM72 is detected in ALS patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and extracellular application of exosomal TRIM72 protects cell from membrane damage. In a sporadic ALS cohort, CSF TRIM72 level associates ALS disease progression. AAV-mediated neuronal expression of TRIM72 slows down the disease progressions in ALS models and in an ALS patient without adverse effects over a year treatment course. Taken together, our results suggest a universal neuronal protection of a TRIM family protein in cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manners in ALS.

Meanwhile, the LDs’ role in other NDs such \nas Huntington’s disease (HD), one of the most prevalent monogenetic NDs, remains unclear. The \nunderlying mechanism, especially the neuronal genes that may mediate the pathological \nconsequence of LDs are also unknown. There has also been a lack of LD-clearance chemical tools \nto study the functions of brain LDs or to provide potential therapeutic strategies for NDs. Here, we \ninvestigated the potential roles of LDs in HD by utilizing a small molecule compound C3 that we \ndeveloped to  trigger selective autophagic degradation of LDs . We observed enhanced LD \naccumulation in HD cellular and aged HD mouse models, as well as post -mortem brain samples \nof HD. Importantly, treatment of C3 significantly reduced the LD level and rescued HD -relevant \nphenotypes in HD neuronal models and aged HD mice (23 and 27 months of age), demonstrating \nthe pathogenic contribution of LDs in HD even at very late stages. We further explored the \nneuronal genes that may mediate the pathological role of LDs in HD by investigating the \ntranscriptome changes after LD clearance by C3 treatment, followed by knock-down screening to \nreveal the key genes that may mediate LD neuronal toxicity. We identified that LD accumulation \nmay led to neuronal toxicity by suppressing the neuron-specific gene PLCH2, which was reversed \nby C3 treatment that lowers LD levels .

Current devices use \npulsatile stimulation with arbitrary, fixed-rate timing, independent at each ear, unlike natural hearing where \nauditory nerve spikes encode temporal features with microsecond precision. We believe that microsecond-\nprecise pulse timing could improve binaural hearing and pitch discrimination, but testing this in humans is \nchallenging given that the patients’ clinical needs often conflict with experimental design. Clinical best \npractice dictates that patients practice listening to the world through devices which use pulse timing that is \nnot only uninformative but potentially confusing. \nTo circumvent this, we studied neonatally deafened rats implanted with Cis in young adulthood, assessing \ntheir behavioral sensitivity to interaural time differences (ITDs).  Notably, we found that our CI rats achieved \nsignificantly better outcomes compared to human patients, and they exhibited the same sensitivity to ITDs as \nsmall as a few tens of microseconds that is normally only seen in normally hearing individuals. Physiological \nrecordings in the inferior colliculus confirmed this precision, showing ITD sensitivity as fine as 40 μs in \nadult-deafened rats, demonstrating long-term preservation of microsecond temporal processing in the deaf \nauditory pathway. Follow-on behavioral experiments further demonstrated that ITDs must be coded in pulse \ntiming, not stimulus envelopes, to be effective, and that even small pulse timing ITDs have the power to \nconfound large interaural level difference (ILD) cues in the recently implanted, deaf auditory pathway. \nThese findings suggest that poor temporal performance in human CI users arises from adaptation to \ninadequate device encoding, implying that improved temporal coding could enhance binaural hearing and \npitch perception.\nKeywords: binaural hearing, cochlear implants, neuroprostheses, temporal coding", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051515012830.pdf"}, {"title": "Functional and Molecular Dissection of Cortical Visual Impairment in CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder", "text": "Talk Title:\nFunctional and Molecular Dissection of Cortical Visual Impairment in CDKL5\nDeficiency Disorder\nIP, Pak Kan Jacque (叶柏勤)\nThe Chinese University of Hong Kong\nEmail: jacqueip@cuhk.edu.hk\nIntroduction:\nCDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder linked to\nthe X chromosome and caused by genetic deficits in Cyclin Dependent\nKinase-like 5 (CDKL5).

Accumulating evidence suggests that cerebellar alterations may be involved in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet its utility as a neuroimaging biomarker remains underexplored. In this work, we investigated whether cerebellum-based MRI radiomics could provide disease-specific information for AD and PD. Using large-scale multicenter and in-house cohorts, we developed machine learning models based on radiomic features extracted from I–V cerebellar lobules. In AD, an integrated radiomic-network model based on these features outperformed hippocampal models in predicting the transition from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment over a 6-year follow-up. In PD, radiomic signatures from both cerebellar gray and white matter effectively distinguished patients from healthy controls. These findings underscore the functional specificity of cerebellar subregions in different neurodegenerative processes and highlight the potential of cerebellum-derived radiomic-network modeling as novel imaging biomarkers for early detection and disease stratification.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25042914393991.pdf"}, {"title": "Cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat drug-resistant epilepsy", "text": "Abstract \nObjective: Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent brain diseases.

Notably, cerebellar dysfunction has been increasingly linked to ASD in both clinical and preclinical studies. In this study, we investigate cerebellar contributions to ASD-related phenotypes using the L7-TSC1 mouse model, which features Purkinje cell-specific deletion of the Tsc1 gene and exhibits behavioral features of ASD. L7-TSC1 mice display abnormal cerebellar network dynamics, including elevated high-frequency oscillations, and enhanced activation of signaling markers such as phosphorylated ERK and c-Fos within the cerebellum. We further identify the altered cerebellar outputs results in hyperactive activity in locus coeruleus (LC) neurons. In turn, the LC hyperactivity might lead to altered mGluR5 signaling in cerebellar glial cells. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 normalizes cerebellar neural activity and rescues social behavior deficits.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving these intertwined processes remain poorly understood. Our recent cross-species comparisons, leveraging single-nucleus transcriptomic profiling of the primate neocortex and allocortex, uncovered molecular specializations in the primate lineage that provide insights into these mechanisms. We identified METTL7B, a primate-specific methyltransferase gene enriched in hippocampal cells, which exhibits neuroprotective roles. This gene may reflect an adaptive response to the more marked signs of pathology related to aging, such as Alzheimer’s disease, observed in primates compared to other species, and could represent a novel therapeutic target. Moreover, we revealed that the neuropsychiatric risk gene FOXP2 displayed primate-specific expression in cortical layer 4 (L4) granular neurons, a pattern highly conserved among the 29 primate species analyzed. Spatiotemporal mapping of FOXP2 expression demonstrated that its L4 expression emerges postnatally, peaks during synaptogenesis and myelination, and persists into adulthood. Intriguingly, FOXP2 tends to be enriched in association areas with protracted postnatal development, in contrast to primary cortical areas with rapid postnatal maturation, especially the primary visual cortex which lacks FOXP2 L4 expression across multiple primate species analyzed. This conserved spatiotemporal signature in primates suggests that FOXP2 plays a critical role in the prolonged development of primate cortical circuits. Building on this, integration of newly generated multi-modal data from developing primate association cortices revealed that FOXP2 and numerous other neuropsychiatric disease risk genes are regulated by evolutionarily constrained genomic sequences in the primate lineage and orchestrate key developmental processes underlying postnatal cortical maturation.

However, metal-based reporter systems often face challenges such as cytotoxicity and low sensitivity. In contrast, aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a metal-free MRI reporter gene, offers enhanced sensitivity with minimal cellular toxicity. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI) has been used to detect monosynaptic projections to the caudate putamen (CPu), labeled via retrogradely transported AQP1 encoded by rAAV2-retro vectors. Moreover, the systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB-DIO enables AQP1 expression across the blood–brain barrier, facilitating the combined structural and functional mapping of neural circuits in vivo, especially when integrated with DREADD-fMRI.

Identifying hub regions and critical circuits within epileptic networks is fundamental to advancing our understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic development. Although the piriform cortex (PC) has long been implicated in seizure generation, three basic questions persist: 1) How does PC hyperactivity reshape whole-brain dynamics? 2) Which specific circuit controls piriform seizures? 3) How does the PC control limbic temporal epilepsy and frontal lobe epilepsy? The present study aims to elucidate the PC's role in seizure initiation, propagation, and regulation. Methods Here, we employed multimodal approaches that integrate fMRI, optogenetics, chemogenetics, multi-site electrophysiology, fiber photometry, neurotropic viral circuit tracing, and behavioral assessments. Results We discovered that hyperactivity of PC Vglut1⁺ neurons drives brain-wide hyperactivation and reorganization. The PCVglut1-Lent-DG trisynaptic pathway is the critical circuit, where disrupting PC-Lent or Lent-DG connections suppresses seizures and aberrant BOLD signals. The elimination of the PC suppresses both the limbic temporal epilepsy and frontal lobe epilepsy.

To address this temporal constraint, Toi et al. proposed DIANA (Direct Imaging Neuronal Activity using MRI), a novel approach claiming millisecond-level temporal resolution and reportedly correlates with invasive local field potential measurements in mice [2]. However, subsequent study failed to replicate the results of DIANA when using a higher field strength (15.2T) [3]. Recently, Valerie et al. challenged DIANA’s validity, which is an artifact caused by the unbalance trigger between different scans and related with stimulus [4]. However, no experiment, as I know, directly observed the signal source. In our study, we try to observed DIANA signal in anesthetized rats at a field strength of 11.7T using phase locking to the stimulus, rather than trigger signal.  Materials and methods Animal preparation: All experiments followed humane animal care standards and complied with the Animal Welfare Act and institute guidelines for laboratory animal use. Nine adult-male Wistar rats were initially anesthetized with 4% isoflurane for 3 minutes, positioned on the MRI bed, and then maintained under sedation with dexmedetomidine injected into the thigh muscle via syringe pump (bolus: 0.017 mg/kg; maintenance: 0.025 mg/kg) [5]. Electrical stimulation was delivered using an ISO-FLEX device (AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel), triggered by the MR scanner via an Arduino board, with electrodes inserted into and secured on the left and right forepaws. A water circulation system was used to maintain the rats' body temperature. Data acquisition: MR scans for all rats were performed on a Bruker 11.7T MR scanner (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) at the Institute of Biophysics using a four-element surface array coil. Structural images were acquired using a T2-TurboRARE sequence, and functional localizer images were obtained with a gradient-echo EPI sequence. Electrical stimulation was applied at 1 mA and 4 Hz with a 0.5% duty cycle (10 seconds on, 50 seconds off, repeated six times). Upon completion of the aforementioned sequence scans, we immediately employed AFNI [6] to compute BOLD-fMRI activation maps. Based on the activation maps, we precisely defined the FOV for subsequent DIANA sequences with submillimeter spatial specificity. For the DIANA scans, trigger intervals were set at 5 × 40 ms, with a total scan time of 8 minutes. Electrical stimulation lasted 0.5 ms at 200 ms interstimulus intervals (40 cycles of 5 ms each), with a current strength of 1 mA. Six scans were conducted in total, one of which included stimulation, with a three-minute rest period between each pair of scans. The DIANA (Direct Imaging of Neuronal Activity) protocol comprised three distinct sequence configurations in this study. The first configuration (Figure 1A) replicated the original DIANA sequence described by Toi et al., while the second configuration (Figure 1B) omitted \\nelectrical stimulation to serve as a non-stimulation control. The third configuration (Figure 1C) introduced parametric variations in stimulus timing by inserting five distinct delay intervals (50ms, 75ms, 100ms, 125ms, and 150ms) between the trigger signal and stimulation onset. Specific sequence parameters are detailed in Table 1. Data analysis: Data processing was performed using MATLAB 2018a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) with the following workflow: 1) image reconstruction and NORDIC-based denoising [7], 2) manual delineation of regions of interest (ROIs) guided by BOLD activation maps without spatial registration or additional preprocessing, and 3) time-series visualization and statistical modeling. The complete analytical pipeline is schematically outlined in Figure 2.  Results Figure 3 illustrates the selection of two different ROIs: the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF), precisely chosen based on the specific activation region observed in BOLD-fMRI, and the whole brain. Figure 4 displays the percentage signal change in DIANA-fMRI for each rat across these two ROIs under both stimulated and non-stimulated conditions. A noticeable signal increase appears 10 ms after the trigger application in both ROIs, regardless of whether electrical stimulation was applied. Figure 5 shows the statistical results of DIANA-fMRI across all rats. Specifically, the activation signal intensity reached 1.47 ± 1.04% in the S1BF ROI, and a comparable activation signal was observed in the whole brain ROI, with an intensity of 1.51 ± 0.97%. Both ROIs exhibited an activation latency of 10 ms, and the signal intensity observed 10 ms after the trigger was significantly different from the intensity at 0ms (p < 0.01). Figure 6. Results and post-processing methods using the third DIANA sequence with different delay times. This approach eliminates artifactual signals induced by the trigger, thereby isolating genuine neuroactivity signals potentially elicited by electrical stimulation. Figure 7 presents the statistical results of the third DIANA sequence applied to the S1BF region. A signal with an approximate intensity of 0.8% was observed at 35ms post-stimulation; however, it did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05).  Discussion and Conclusion We observed a stable activation of about 1.5%, which is probably the “DIANA” signal. This signal was delayed 15-20ms relative to the trigger, rather than association with stimulus. And we can observe the signal across the whole brain. We further employed an improved stimulus design; wherein varying delay times were introduced between the trigger signal and stimulation onset to eliminate artifacts induced by the trigger and to investigate genuine neural activity. We observed a signal increase of approximately 0.8% at 35ms post-stimulation, which is related with electric stimulus, maybe a true DIANA signal. Although this change did not reach statistical significance, due to smaller samples, limited the scanning time and low signal intensity. Our findings may provide encouragement for continued investigation. Future studies should prioritize the systematic elimination of confounding variables, including but not limited to rodent strain heterogeneity, electrical stimulation parameters (e.g., pulse width, amplitude), and motion-induced artifacts during MRI acquisition, to establish robust and reproducible neural correlates.

China's 2020 population stood at 1.4118 \nbillion, of which 264 million are aged 60 and over or 191 million are aged 65 and over, comprising \n18.7 percent and 13.5 percent of the total population, respectively. Due to their age, elderly patients \nare at a higher risk of experiencing complications related to the central nervous system during \nperioperative care. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) is an overarching term that includes \npostoperative delirium (POD), an acute state of confusion and inattention, and post -operative \ncognitive dysfunction (POCD), a prolonged state of mental impairment that predominantly affects \nhigher-level cognitive skills and memory.  POD and POCD were previously considered distinct entities. \nStill, recent data suggest an underlying relationship between them for the patient whose brain may \nbe vulnerable to cognitive decline after the stress of surgery and anesthesia.  \n \nOur project  aims to establish a precise and accurate system for assessing Postoperative \nNeurocognitive Disorder (PND). We are working towards understanding how characteristic markers of \nthe aged brain contribute to the development of cognitive impairments after surgery. Our research \ngroup focused on the key science of the perioperative imbalance of brain homeostasis in the elderly. \nA series of basic -clinical-translational studies revealed a new mechanism of neuron -glia-vascular \ninteractions in the imbalance of brain homeostasis in the elderly  (Adv Sci, 2024; BJA 2024; Aging Cell, \n2024; Cell Mol Life Sci , 2024). We also  created a n extensiv e database of medical data in the \nperioperative period of the elderly, cross -integrated AI and large language learning models to \nconstruct a new precision diagnosis and treatment system that integrates AI traceable prediction, \nperioperative multimodal monitoring, and assisted decision -making (HEAL LLMs); developed a series \nof artificial neural devices, built a brain -like simulation platform, explored multi-channel neural brain-\ncomputer interfaces, and proposed a new strategy for ultra -early warning of perioperative functional \nhomeostasis imbalance in the elderly brain  (Infomat, 2021; Chem Commun , 2021; J Mater Chem C  \nmater, 2022; ACS Appl. Mater , 2023; Adv Mater, 2024). These results a im to improve  the medium- \nand long-term outcomes of elderly patients after surgery. \n \nAbstract \nThe traditional view is that the excitatory -inhibitory homeostasis of neurons in the cortex is an \nessential mechanism for the shift in consciousness caused by anesthesia. However, the monitoring of \ncortical electrical activity carried out in recent years (such as BIS, EEG, etc.) has not yielded conclusive \nresults, especially in patients of different ages, d rugs, and  pathological states . These results show \nthat focusing only on neurons cannot fully reflect the processes and mechanisms of anesthesia -\n\\nrelated changes in consciousness. It is urgent to analyze the interactive regulatory relationship \nbetween neural activity and different cells and components during anesthesia from a new perspective. \n \nThe neurovascular unit (NVU) is the structural basis for the brain to function , and changes in the \ninteractions between different cells are an essential cause of changes in conscious states. Therefore, \nfrom the perspective of NVU cell interactions, exploring the laws of NVU changes during anesthesia \nand surgery and its potential mechanism in conscious transformation is of great clinical significance \nfor finding key targets for regulating NVU and proposing precise interventions. In our previous study, \nwe used spatial transcriptomics combined with single -cell sequencing technology to conduct a time \nseries analysis of different NVU cells after anesthesia and found that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and \nhippocampus (HPC) are the central brain regions affected by anesthesia and surgery, and the \nconstituent cells of the NVU all have different dynamic evolutionary characteristics, which play an \nessential role in the process of consciousness disorders after anesthesia. \n \nNVC relies on the coordinated interaction among active neurons, astrocytes, smooth muscle cells, and \nendothelial cells. In recent years, the advancement of multimodal brain imaging techniques, such as \nfMRI, functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and EEG, has provided essential tools for \ninvestigating the mechanisms of NVC and exploring the spatiotemporal dynamic interactions with \ngreater detail. However, there is still a lack of a combined monitoring and management paradigm for \nchanges in neural activity and blood flow in animals and perioperative patients.  The research group \nhas previously overcome key technical barriers to combined brain function monitoring and pioneered \nvarious multimodal brain function monitoring techniques for mice. Additionally, it has accumulated \nspecific experience in perioperative multimodal brain function monitoring, along with assessments of \npostoperative cognitive tasks and clinical functions, by integrating the risk factors of postoperative \nawareness disorders in patients with perioperative neuroimaging and blood flow data. A traceable \nHEAL multimodal model has been developed. This work has further bolstered our efforts to utilize \nNVC as a focal point for analyzing the mechanisms behind postoperative awareness disorders and for \nestablishing an NVC -oriented brain function monitoring system, as well as strategies for the \nprevention and control of POD. \n \nTitle: Neurovascular Decoupling Mechanism and Precise Anesthetic Strategies for Peri -op Cognitive \nDisorders", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051316493772.pdf"}, {"title": "Maestros of anesthesia: from microglia with love", "text": "Maestros of anesthesia: from microglia with love  General anesthesia leads to a loss of consciousness and an unrousable state in patients.

Microglia are important immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that play critical roles in CNS function and dysfunction. We unintentionally observed delayed anesthesia induction and early anesthesia emergence in microglia-depleted mice. We found that microglial depletion differentially regulates neuronal activities by suppressing the neuronal network of anesthesia-activated brain regions and activating emergence-activated brain regions. Thus, microglia facilitate and stabilize the anesthesia status. This influence is not mediated by dendritic spine plasticity. Instead, it relies on the activation of microglial P2Y12 and subsequent calcium influx, which facilitates the general anesthesia response. Together, we elucidate the regulatory role of microglia in general anesthesia, extending our knowledge of how nonneuronal cells modulate neuronal activities.

UBAP1, a \nubiquitin-associated protein, is a component of the  endosomal sorting complexes required for \ntransport (ESCRT) and its deletion mutations lead to hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) diseases. \nOur previous studies have revealed  that the absence of UBAP1 results in abnormal proliferation \nand differentiation of neural stem cells, ultimately causing motor neuron apoptosis. However, the \nunderlying pathological mechanism is unclear. Here we found the loss of UBAP1 leads to \nlysosomal dysfunction, disrupting the localization of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 \n(mTORC1) on lysosomal membranes. This dysregulation is accompanied by the  \ndephosphorylation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and aberrant activation of mTORC1 \nsignaling. Administration of rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR pathway, enhances its \nlysosomal localization and TFEB phosphorylation. This pharmacological intervention effectively \nattenuated disease progression and restored lysosomal homeostasis in Ubap1 deficiency mice. Our \nfindings have uncovered the roles of UBAP1 in regulating lysosome homeostasis and raise the \npossibility that rapamycin may offer therapeutic benefit to  HSP patients and potentially other \nmotor neuron disorders. \nKey words: Lysosome; UBAP1; Hereditary spastic paraplegias; mTORC1; Rapamycin", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25050916095122.pdf"}, {"title": "Genetic programs and mechanics underlying spatio-temporal pattern of cortical folding", "text": "Genetic programs and mechanics underlying spatio -temporal pattern of cortical \nfolding \nLianyan Li1,2, Yiqin Bai3, Pengyu Yu4, Jie Gao3, Jianbin Guo5, Longzhong Jia1,2, Li Gu1,2, Ruijuan \nLiang1,2, Yashan Dang1,2, Yiming Yan1,2, Hanqing Hou1,2, Yelan Wei1,2, Yihang Wang1,2, Xiaohan \nLi1,2, Lan Zhu5, Shaojie Ma3, Bo Li4, Yidi Sun3, Da Mi1,2* \n1.

We provide a \ncomprehensive description of the heterogeneity in gene expression, cellular composition, geometry, \nand biophysical properties of the cortex before sulcus formation. Our findings indicate that  the \nspatial variations in cortical geometry, growth rates, and mechanical properties are crucial in \ndetermining the placement of cortical folds. Furthermore, by comparing different folds, we identify \ndistinct profiles in these features, which are shaped by the developmental stages of their formation. \nThis suggests that each cortical fold likely follows a unique patterning mechanism.

Methods We used fiber photometry, opto-/chemo-genetics, in vitro electrophysiology, and other techniques to study the function of BNST neurons in anxiety and immune function. Results In our study, we found that stress-induced susceptibility to anxiety showed sex difference, and the stress-induced corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) release in oval nucleus of BNST (ovBNST) showed a female-biased pattern. Moreover, during stress, ovBNST CRF neurons were activated with a persistent manner in female mice, but a transient manner in male mice. Optogenetic modulation to exchange the activation pattern of ovBNST CRF neurons during stress between female and male mice could reverse their susceptibility to anxiety. On the other hand, we also found that ovBNST CRF neurons indirectly innervate peripheral immune organs through multi-level projections. Chemogenetic modulation of ovBNST CRF neurons could potentially regulate peripheral immune function.

Several recent FDA-approved drugs are only modestly effective for slowing down symptom progression of AD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Therefore, identifying cognitively normal individuals at high risk for AD and development of novel therapeutic strategies are of great importance to the neurodegeneration field. To address these issues, we need a spatiotemporal atlas of hippocampus at single cell level covering different stages of AD pathogenesis, from young early stage with no cognitive defects to aged late stage with severe cognitive impairments. Here we employed an integrative approach combining single-nucleus RNA-seq with high-resolution spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively characterize cellular dynamics in the hippocampus during aging and AD progression in mouse models. Our analysis identified distinct neuronal subpopulations with differential susceptibility to AD pathology. While certain neuronal clusters remained stable throughout disease progression, others were markedly depleted in late-stage AD. Spatial mapping revealed region-specific vulnerability patterns and enabled evaluation of intercellular communication dynamics, uncovering potential links between cellular crosstalk, fate decisions, and AD pathology. Notably, we identified a panel of neuroprotective factors, including specific ligand-receptor pairs and intrinsic signaling molecules, that significantly regulate neuronal survival in AD conditions. By integrative analysis of spatiotemporal multiomics data, we reconstructed the complete trajectory of hippocampal cell subtype dynamics across the aging-AD progression continuum, thereby establishing a comprehensive single-cell resolution atlas of hippocampal cellular evolution during physiological aging and AD pathogenesis. These findings provide transformative insights into AD pathological mechanisms and establish a framework for developing precision neuroprotective strategies targeting aging-related neurodegeneration.

Corresponding author \nAbstract \nExisting treatments for chronic pain often prove ineffective and always carry adverse \nside effects, highlighting the need for better analgesics, including non-pharmacological \ntreatments. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a widely used, non-\ninvasive therapy for alleviating both acute and chronic pain. Previous studies suggest \nthat TENS exerts its analgesic effects primarily through the spinal \"gate control theory.\" \nAccording to this model, TENS activates large -diameter A β low-threshold \nmechanoreceptor (LTMR) fibers in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which, in turn, \nstimulate inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. This suppresses the activity of \nspinal dorsal horn pain projection neurons, effectively blocking pain signal \ntransmission to the brain. H owever, beyond their spinal projections, DRG Aβ-LTMR \nneurons also send collateral branches via the gracile fasciculus to the gracile nucleus in \nthe brainstem. Whether this somatosensory topographical pathway contributes to \nTENS-mediated analgesia remains un clear, warranting further investigation into its \nunderlying mechanisms. \nIn this study, we demonstrate that repeated  transcutaneous electrical nerve \nstimulation (rTENS) treatment, initiated early after nerve injury produces significant \nand long-lasting analgesic effects. Contrary to the conventional gate -control theory in \nthe spinal cord, our findings reveal that TENS alleviates pain through a supraspinal \nmechanism by activating a specific subpopulation of glutamatergic neurons in the \ndorsal column nuclei (DCNGlu). These neurons project to distinct glutamatergic neurons \nin the thalamic ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL DCN, Glu), which differ from those \nreceiving primary sensory input from the spinal dorsal horn (VPL SDH, Glu). VPLDCN, Glu \nneurons then form monosynaptic connections with layer 5 (L5) neurons  in the \\nsomatosensory hindlimb cortex (S1HL), mediating the analgesic effect induced by \nTNES. This newly identified pathway leads to effective analgesia with minimal adverse \nside effects, offering a promising therapeutic option for chronic pain. \nKey words \nPain, Analgesia, Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,  Dorsal column nuclei, \nThalamic ventral posterolateral nucleus", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051114281262.pdf"}, {"title": "Crosstalk between nociceptive innervation and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and cancer pain", "text": "Title: Nociceptor neurons promote PDAC progression and cancer pain by interaction with cancer-\nassociated fibroblasts and suppression of natural killer cells \nAuthors: \nKaiyuan Wang1*, Bo Ni 2*, Yongjie Xie2*, Zekun Li 2, Limei Yuan 1, Chenyang Meng2, Tiansuo \nZhao2, Song Gao 2, Chongbiao Huang 2, Hongwei Wang 2, Ying Ma 2, Tianxing Zhou 2, Yukuan \nFeng2, Antao Chang2, Chao Yang2, Jun Yu 2, Wenwen Yu2, Fenglin Zang 2, Yanhui Zhang2, Ru-\nRong Ji3,4,5, Xiuchao Wang2 and Jihui Hao2 \nAffiliations: \n1Department of Anesthesiology, 2Pancreas Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and \nHospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, State Key Laboratory of Druggability \nEvaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, \nTianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin 300060, China \n3Center for Translational Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology; 4Department of Cell \nBiology; and 5Department of Neurobiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, \nUSA \n*These three authors contribute equally to this study. \nCorrespondence to:  \nJihui Hao: Huanhuxi Road, Hexi District, Tianjin 30060, China; Tel: 0086 18622221120; Fax: \n0086 23340123; Email: haojihui@tjmuch.com \nXiuchao Wang: Huanhuxi Road, Hexi District, Tianjin 30060, China; Tel: 0086 137 52038814; \nFax: 0086 23340123; Email: wangxiuchao@tjmuch.com \nRu-Rong Ji: MSRB III, 3 Genome Court, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA ; Tel: 919-684-\n9387; Fax: 919-684-2411; Email: ru-rong.ji@duke.edu  \nKaiyuan Wang: Huanhuxi Road, Hexi District, Tianjin 30060, China; Tel: 0086 13803036415; \nFax: 0086 23340123; Email: kywang@tmu.edu.cn \n \n \n \n \\nAbstract  \nThe emerging field of cancer neuroscience has demonstrated great progress in revealing the crucial \nrole of the nervous system in cancer initiation and progression.

This study investigated\nwhether enhancing somatosensory α-oscillations via tACS or neurofeedback could attenuate pain\nperception. Methods In a double-blind, sham-controlled design, participants received either\nα-tACS or sham stimulation over unilateral primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) using a 4×1 ring\nelectrode configuration. Neural responses to laser nociceptive stimuli were assessed via fMRI or\nEEG before and after intervention. Additionally, we evaluated whether and how neurofeedback\ntargeting on somatosensory α-oscillations affects laser-evoked phasic pain and capsaicin-induced\ntonic pain. Results α-tACS indirectly reduced pain perception by suppressing activity in the\ntargeted SM1 and decreasing functional connectivity between SM1 and key pain-processing\nregions (e.g., middle cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). EEG analysis revealed\nthat while α-tACS-induced somatosensory α-enhancement provided analgesia, its prolonged\namplification of midfrontal θ-oscillations paradoxically promoted hyperalgesia under certain pain\nexpectations. Neurofeedback training targeting somatosensory α-oscillations alleviated both\nphasic and tonic pain but via distinct global brain dynamics.

In this study, we have designed a new reciprocity paradigm, and \ndemonstrate that rats’ reciprocity behavior can stably establish even in the absence of \nthe external mechanisms. Additionally, reciprocity experiences can enhance the \nempathy of wild type rats, but not oxytocin -deficient rats, towards their partners. \nFurthermore, oxytocin-deficient rats exhibit more free-riding behaviors.

Emerging evidence suggests that the placenta contributes to sex differences in the prevalence of certain developmental disorders, including neurodevelopmental conditions. To investigate fetal sex-specific transcriptional changes within the placenta at a molecular level, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing. Our analysis revealed that trophoblasts associated with male fetuses exhibited lower expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) compared to those linked to female fetuses. Notably, maternal immune activation (MIA), which induces neurodevelopmental abnormalities predominantly in male offspring, disrupted these sex-specific differences in the placenta. To explore the potential connection between sex-specific ISG expression and neurodevelopmental outcomes in MIA offspring, we selectively deleted IFN alpha and beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) in trophoblasts. Loss of IFNAR1 in the placenta mitigated MIA-induced behavioral abnormalities in male offspring.

This framework effectively examines and quantifies natural behaviors with complex dynamic features, providing significant insights into the biological significance of sex differences in behavior and their neural underpinnings (Ye et al., 2025, Cell Reports); 2) by using HBAF, we revealed that male and female mice employ different strategies when escaping threats, yet their escape abilities remain consistent throughout their lifespan (Liu et al., 2022, BMC Biology); 3) furthermore, we identified the crucial role of GABAergic subcortical circuits in female mice, which evaluate risk in response to looming stimuli, thereby mediating defensive behavior.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051412132255.pdf"}, {"title": "Neuroprotection and glial responses following axotomy and treatment with doubly reduced demeclocycline (DDMC) in neonatal rats", "text": "Neuroprotection and glial responses following axotomy and treatment with \ndoubly reduced demeclocycline (DDMC) in neonatal rats \n \nOliveira ALR*1,4, Sacheto G1,4, Del-Bel E2,4, Raisman R3, Cartarozzi LP1,4 \n \n1Laboratory of Nerve Regeneration, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas – UNICAMP , \nBrazil \n2University of Sao Paulo- Dental School of Ribeirao Preto, Department of Basic and Oral \nBiology, Brazil \n3Experimental Therapeutics of Parkinson’ s Disease, Paris Brain Institute – CNRS UMR 7225 – \nInserm U 1127 – Sorbonne Université UM75, Paris, France \n4Center for Gender Specific Biology and Medicine - CGBM - Brazil \n \n*Corresponding author E-mail:alroliv@unicamp.br  \n \nAbstract: Objective Neonatal axotomy has been shown to induce significant retrograde \ndegeneration of spinal motoneurons and sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia.

Connexin 43 (Cx43), a key mediator of intercellular communication via gap junctions and hemichannels, plays multifaceted roles in central nervous system (CNS) physiology and pathology. We previously reported that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), reactive astrocytes exhibit heightened Cx43 hemichannel activity, releasing ATP and glutamate that exacerbate neuronal damage, while genetic ablation of astrocytic Cx43 reduces gliotransmitter release and plaque-associated neurodegeneration, highlighting therapeutic potential. Building on this, we revealed that microglial Cx43 hemichannels are upregulated in AD, driving pro-inflammatory responses that worsen β-amyloid pathology; conditional knockout shifts microglia to a neuroprotective state, enhancing plaque compaction and reducing neurodegeneration. Given the therapeutic potential of targeting both astrocytic and microglial Cx43 hemichannels, we devised a lipid nanoparticle-based Cx43 hemichannel inhibitor drug, TAT-Cx43@LNPs, which rescues cognitive deficits in preclinical AD models. Furthermore, we demonstrated a novel functioning mechanism of microglial Cx43 during neurodevelopment: Cx43 transiently localizes to microglial nuclei, restraining excessive microglia reactivity in the neurogenic niche; developmental knockout induces hyperreactive microgliosis, neural progenitor apoptosis, leading to postweaning hippocampal neural stem cell loss and cognitive deficits. Together, these findings position Cx43 as a versatile regulator of glial behavior, offering therapeutic avenues in AD through hemichannel modulation, and revealing its nuclear role in ensuring developmental microglial quiescence for lifelong neural health, bridging mechanistic insights with translational innovation in neurodegeneration and neurodevelopmental disorders.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051423483356.pdf"}, {"title": "Defining mechanisms of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases using advanced organ-on-a-chip models", "text": "Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are multifactorial and heterogeneous conditions and leading cause of morbidity and mortality.

However, the \nunderlying causes and pathogenetic mechanisms remain largely obscure. Recent studies \nhave ex panded the understanding of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) by \ndemonstrating their interactions with multiple cell types in the central nervous system \n(CNS). In a physiological context of OPC-neuron interaction, OPCs are unique among \nglial cells as they form direct synaptic connections with neurons by expressing multiple \nsynapse-related genes, allowing them to passively receive signal inputs from neurons, \nthen adjusting their development accordingly, which further refine the activity of neural \ncircuits. Conversely, in pathological conditions, OPCs impede synaptogenesis of \nhippocampal neurons associated with schizophrenia, and facilitate the release of GABA \nthrough synaptic complexes with hippocampal interneurons, thereby contribut ing to \nanxiety onset. In this study, we revealed that BAF155, a newly identified chromatin \nremodeling factor linked to autism susceptibility, is primarily expressed in committed \nOPCs. Within these cells, BAF155 influences the OPC differentiation and myelination \nby integrating the expressions of multiple synapse -related genes  in establishing \nsynaptic communication s between OPCs and neurons.

Higher \ntemperatures tend to suppress the s-LNv response to light, whereas lower temperatures enhance it, \nthereby influencing the animal's adaptation to new light-dark cycles. \nExpanding the scope to sleep homeostatic mechanisms, this study focused on the discovery \nand characterization of a crucial population of ascending neurons (ANs) located in the ventral nerve \ncord (VNC). These ANs se rve as critical integrators of behavioral and physiological states, \nrepresenting a key node for brain -body interaction. Their activity level is tightly correlated with \nprevious locomotion and energy expenditure, potentially reflecting the sensing of muscle metabolic \nproducts generated during prior activity. By integrating this peripheral information, these ANs \ninfluence central brain neuromodulatory systems, such as dopaminergic neurons (DANs), thereby \nparticipating in the maintenance of sleep balance. These findings offer new perspectives on existing \nviews regarding the central mechanisms of sleep homeostasis, challenging established views on the \nrole of dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) neurons. \nIn summary, this study revealed multiple interconnected neural cir cuits and neuropeptide \nsignaling pathways within the Drosophila brain and peripheral nervous system. These complex \nsystems synergistically integrate diverse environmental signals (temperature, light) and internal \nstate information to precisely regulate sle ep initiation, duration, and intensity.

The Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)\nhypothesis proposes that conscious access can be decomposed into two distinct steps: 1) The\npropagation of bottom-up signals to higher levels in the GNW (e.g., prefrontal cortex)\nrepresents the first step that characterizes the threshold level of activity necessary for\nconscious ignition; 2) Broadcasting the information is the second step, achieved through top-\ndown signals that actively gate sensory stimuli into a WM state with persistent firing loops.\nHowever, the characterization of the neural geometry and its dynamics of conscious access at\nthe single or population levels remains largely unexplored. We recorded thousands of neurons\nin the lateral PFC of macaque monkeys performing a masked sequence WM reproduction task\nwith varying stimulus contrasts (0–100%). Our findings reveal that conscious access to spatial\nsequences follows a two-step process: transient continues sensory encoding in an entry\nsubspace, followed by sustained, all-or-none activity in rank-WM subspaces. Importantly, top-\ndown attentional resources and context-dependent internal states of temporal structure\ndynamically modulate this process, highlighting the PFC's critical role in integrating bottom-up\nsensory input with internal models to shape conscious perception.\nKeywords: Conscious access; Working memory; Prefrontal cortex; Representational geometry", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25072213524442.pdf"}, {"title": "Deciphering the Neurometabolic Regulatory Architecture: From Environmental Inputs to Brain Homeostasis", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Decoding the Neural Mechanisms of Depression: Insights Through Ketamine’s Pharmacological Lens", "text": "", "url": ""}, {"title": "Clinically inspired basic research in neuroscience", "text": "", "url": ""}]</script>
