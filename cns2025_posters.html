Many \nbrain functions depend on  the coordinated regulation  of multiple neurotransmitters and integrated control over \ndownstream signaling pathways. To gain a better understanding of their regulation and functional roles, there is an \nurgent need to monitor multiple neurotransmitters or other neurochemicals simulta neously. One such crucial \nneurotransmitter is dopamine (DA), which plays a pivotal role in regulating various physiological functions, including \nlearning, motor control and reward. To meet this challenge, we developed a far-red DA sensor based on the G protein-\ncoupled receptor activation (GRAB) strategy, named GRAB haloDA (HaloDA1.0 in short). This sensor leverages the G \nprotein-coupled receptor activation (GRAB) strategy and a cpHaloTag -based chemigenetic approach, offering robust \nsensitivity, high specificity, rapid sub-second response kinetics, and an expansive spectral range. In combination with \nexisting green and red neuromodulator sensors, Ca2+ indicators, cAMP sensors, and optogenetic tools, the HaloDA1.0 \nsensor exhibits great versatility for multiplex imaging in cultured neurons, acute brain slices, and in behaving animals \nlike zebrafish and mice in vivo. Its modular, tunable design can be extended to other GPCRs and protein tags, providing \na versatile platform for tracking multiple neurotransmitters and advancing our understanding of neurochemical \nregulation in health and disease. \nKeywords: neurotransmitter, dopamine, sensor, multiplex imaging", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051414180522.pdf"}, {"title": "Cerebrospinal fluid β2-microglobulin promotes the tau pathology through microglia–astrocyte communication in Alzheimer's disease", "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid β2-microglobulin promotes the tau\npathology through microglia–astrocyte communication in\nAlzheimer's disease\nZehu Sheng1, Weihua Yu2,* and Yang Lü1,*\n1Department of Geriatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University,\nChongqing 400016, China.\n2Institutes of Neuroscience, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.\n*Correspondence author Email: yanglyu@hospital.cqmu.edu.cn\nABSTRACT:\nObjective: We intended to explore the associations of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma\nβ2-microglobulin (β2M) levels with glial activation and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers and\nascertain their interrelationships.\nMethods: Total of 211 participants from ADNI with CSF and Plasma β2M, CSF glial fibrillary\nacidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2),\nβ-amyloid (Aβ42), phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and total tau (T-tau) were included and divided\nbased on the NIA-AA criteria.

China   *Corresponding Author  Email: guangyinxu@suda.edu.cn  Abstract Objective: Normal maternal instincts are critical for species survival and offspring care. Maternal instincts impairment severely affects offspring development and the physical health of parents. However, the neural mechanisms underlying maternal instinct impairment remain unclear, greatly limiting the development of clinical treatments. In this study, we induced maternal instinct impairment in mice through neonatal maternal separation (NMS) and investigated the underlying neural circuits, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for clinical therapeutic strategies. Methods: Nesting score, latency of retrieval, full time of retrieval, and dam-pup interaction time were used to assess maternal instinctive behavior. Monosynaptic viral tracing visualized the ACCGlu-LSVGABA-PVNOT neural circuit. c-Fos immunofluorescence staining assessed brain activation. Optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques were performed to evaluate the role of the ACCGlu-LSVGABA-PVNOT circuit in maternal behavior. Results: (1) Both predictable and unpredictable NMS caused maternal instinct impairment; (2) LSVGABA neurons were dramatically activated during maternal instinct impairment and optogenetic inhibition of these neurons alleviated the behavioral deficits. (3) Viral tracing revealed the ACCGlu-LSVGABA-PVNOT neural circuit. (4) Optogenetic manipulation of ACCGlu and PVNOT neurons significantly altered maternal instincts behavior. (5) Combined optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation of the ACCGlu-LSVGABA-PVNOT pathway markedly alters maternal instinctive behavior. (6) Intranasal oxytocin significantly improved maternal instinct impairment. Conclusions: (1) NMS induces maternal instinct impairment in mice. (2) LSVGABA neurons mediate maternal instinct impairment. (3) ACCGlu and PVNOT neurons play key roles during maternal instinct impairment.

ER stress has been linked to addiction, yet its neuron-specific role and connection to sphingolipid metabolism remain obscure. We examined whether ER stress in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSN)-and its coupling to sphingolipid metabolism-drives cocaine addiction. Methods Male C57BL/6J mice received repeated cocaine. ER-stress markers, ATF4, SPTLC1 and sphingolipids were quantified (RNAscope, IF, Western blot, LC–MS/MS). ATF4 binding to the Sptlc1 promoter was confirmed by dual-luciferase and ChIP assays. ER stress or ATF4-SPTLC1 signalling was blocked pharmacologically or with AA V-shRNA. Results (1) Repeated cocaine triggered strong ER stress in NAc, sharply up‑regulating ATF4 and SPTLC1 in D1‑MSNs, boosting de‑novo sphingolipid synthesis. (2) ATF4 directly bound the Sptlc1 promoter, driving its transcription. (3) Pharmacological blockade of ER stress (4-PBA), inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis (myriocin) or knockdown of Atf4/Sptlc1 in D1‑MSNs abolished cocaine-induced neurobehaviors. Conclusion ER stress in NAc D1‑MSNs is a critical driver of cocaine‑induced neurobehavioural adaptations through an ATF4‑SPTLC1–sphingolipid pathway. Targeting this signalling cascade offers a promising therapeutic strategy for cocaine addiction.

Although females are generally considered more susceptible to developing pain symptoms than males, previous studies have reported male-specific pain hypersensitivity. The mechanisms underlying these sexually dimorphic phenomena have remained largely unknown. Methods The function of the mPOA→vlPAG pathway required for male-specific contextual pain hypersensitivity in mice was identified using a combination of viral tracing, in vivo fiber photometry, multi-tetrode recordings, optogenetic, in vivo microdialysis-ELISA and pharmacological tools. Results (1) Elevated free-testosterone leads to hyperactivity of GlumPOA neurons through activation of androgen receptor signaling, which in turn induces contextual pain hypersensitivity in male mice. (2) Although not observed in naïve female mice, this pain phenotype could be induced in females via chronic administration of testosterone propionate.

This\nis likely due to multifactorial injury mechanisms following reperfusion, including oxidative stress,\nblood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, microvascular dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Current\npharmacological strategies primarily target single mechanisms and show limited efficacy. This\nstudy aims to investigate the neuroprotective potential of intermittent normobaric hyperoxia\ntherapy (IBO) as a novel multi-target intervention during the post-reperfusion phase of ischemic\nstroke. Methods A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model was used in mice.\nIBO interventions with varying oxygen concentrations (30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%) and cycling\npatterns (e.g., 5-min hyperoxia/5-min normoxia, 10-min/10-min) were administered for three\nconsecutive days after reperfusion. Infarct volume, neurological function, and cerebral blood flow\nwere evaluated. The optimal IBO regimen was further compared to Edaravone Dexborneol, a\nclinically used neuroprotective agent. Results IBO significantly reduced infarct volume, improved\nneurological outcomes, enhanced cerebral perfusion. In several parameters, this regimen showed\ncomparable or superior efficacy to Edaravone Dexborneol.

Prof. Jia Liu; liujia_19901005@163.com    Prof. Xunming Ji; jixm@ccmu.edu.cn Abstract: Objective Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of Lewy bodies (LBs). Phosphorylated α-synuclein at serine 129 (p-S129 α-syn) is a major LB component, yet its role in PD pathogenesis remains controversial. Although prior studies have suggested potential physiological and pathological functions of S129 phosphorylation, its in vivo role remains unverified, and no animal models specifically targeting this site have been systematically characterized. Methods We generated α-synuclein S129A knock-in mice to mimic the dephosphorylated state and S129D knock-in mice to mimic constitutive phosphorylation. Comprehensive behavioral, neuropathological, and molecular analyses were conducted to elucidate the role of S129 phosphorylation in PD. Results Unexpectedly, S129A knock-in mice progressively developed a full spectrum of PD-like symptoms within the first year, including olfactory deficits, gastrointestinal dysfunction, motor impairments, and mild cognitive decline—recapitulating both non-motor and motor features of PD. Histopathological analyses revealed hallmark PD abnormalities, including progressive DA neuron loss, α-syn aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and pronounced microglial activation, closely mimicking the temporal and pathological evolution of human PD. Conclusion This study provides the first in vivo evidence that loss of phosphorylation at α-syn S129 can initiate and drive Parkinsonian pathology. The S129A knock-in mouse thus represents a novel, robust model that faithfully replicates the full course of PD progression, offering a powerful platform for mechanistic research and therapeutic development.

This interpersonal motor synchrony is linked to social and affective processes, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Since such synchrony arises through real-time interactions, a multi-brain approach is essential. However, analyzing brain activity between two individuals introduces a multiple comparisons problem. To address this, we leveraged a machine learning approach - connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) - to interbrain analysis, which identifies behaviorally relevant brain connectivity without extensive multiple comparisons. Methods We conducted hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging on 27 pairs of participants performing rhythmic hand movements. Each participant's movement was projected to their partner via video system, enabling mutual observation. The phase relationship between their movements and functional connectivity matrix of interbrain were used as input variables for CPM. Results As expected, participants synchronized their movements during real-time interaction. The CPM analysis revealed that interpersonal synchrony in real-time interactions was predicted by connectivity within an interbrain network involving the mirror system.

Through temporal transcriptional \nprofiling of DRG neurons at 0, 3, 12, and 24 hours post-sciatic nerve injury (SNI), we identified 11 \nmolecularly distinct neuronal subty pes and characterized their dynamic transcriptional responses, \nrevealing coordinated regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways, ion transport mechanisms, \nand synaptic remodeling processes. To decipher the molecular determinants of regenerative \ncompetence, we developed a novel dual-model analytical framework: (1) An artificial intelligence \n(AI)-powered predictive model utilizing deep neural netw orks trained on comprehensive \nregeneration-associated gene expression datasets; (2) A complementary empirical s coring system \nbased on UCell -quantified regeneration gene signatures. This integrated computational strategy \nenabled robust stratification of neuronal populations into \"regenerative\" and \"non -regenerative\" \nclusters, uncovering critical intrinsic regulators of regenerative heterogeneity, including differential \nexpression patterns of key transcription factors (e.g., Socs3, Klf9) and distinct activation states of \ngrowth-associated molecular pathways. Furthermore, systematic cell-cell communication analysis \nthrough ligand -receptor interaction mapping (employing both Lignature and MetaLigand \nalgorithms) identified fibroblast -derived Ddr2 -Col1/3 signaling as a pivotal extrinsic regulatory \nmechanism. Functional validation experiments demonstrated that Ddr2 overexpression significantly \nenhanced axonal outgrowth in primary DRG neuron cultures. Importantly, in vivo studies using \noptic nerve injury (ONC) models confirmed the conserved regenerative effects of Ddr2 modulation \nin the CNS.

Deciphering the regulatory mechanisms driving its expansion in\nneuronal number and surface area is essential for elucidating the unique features of the human\nbrain. Here, we demonstrate that ERK and PKA signaling pathways coordinately maintain the\nneurogenic identity and lineage specification of cortical radial glia (RGs) by suppressing\ngliogenic YAP and SHH signaling. Conversely, YAP signaling promotes the RG-ependymal\nglial cell lineage by inhibiting ERK, PKA, and SHH signaling, while SHH signaling\nfacilitates the generation of cortical tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs) from\nRGs by repressing ERK, PKA, and YAP signaling. Cortical Tri-IPCs exhibit a sequential\ndifferentiation potential, giving rise to cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and olfactory\nbulb interneurons. Importantly, we provide compelling evidence for the evolutionary\nconservation of these molecular mechanisms between mice and humans. Thus, ERK and PKA\nsignaling in cortical RGs establish a mutually reinforcing positive feedback loop, mediated\nthrough repressing gliogenic YAP and SHH signaling, which collectively promote RG\nproliferation, protect neurogenesis, and drive human cortical expansion.

There is increasing \nevidence of a functional link between the gut microbiota and the development of ASD, although the \nunderlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Mll5 is considered a candidate gene for ASD. \nNonetheless, the role and mechanism of Mll5 in regulating the gut microbiota and the development \nof ASD are unclear. In this study, we observed that Mll5+/- mice, used as models of ASD, exhibit \ndisturbances in their gut microbiota. Transplantation of the fecal microbiota from Mll5+/- mice \nresulted in ASD-like behavior in antibiotic-treated C57BL/6J mice, and transplantation of the fecal \nmicrobiota from wild-type (WT) mice ameliorated the ASD -like behavior in Mll5 +/- mice.

In the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), three types of pruriceptive neurons—\nMrgprd+, Nppb+, and Mrgpra3+ neurons—mediate itch induced by various pruritogens. While the \nfunctions of these genes are partially understood, the  upstream regulatory factors and their \nmechanisms remain unclear, and the developmental process of pruriceptive neurons is still not well \nunderstood. This study identifies Krüppel-Like Factor 5 (Klf5)  as a key transcription factor \nregulating the developmen t of pruriceptive neurons.  Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing data \nfrom developing DRG were analyzed using the SCENIC to construct the gene regulatory network \nand identify key regulators controlling the dynamic changes of itch -related genes. Cultured \nembryonic DRG neurons were used to investigate the effects of Klf5 and Runx1 on Mrgprd \nexpression and whether they mutually regulate each other. Transgenic mice were employed to \nexamine the role of Klf5 in pruriceptive neuron development and its impact on itch-related behavior. \nResults SCENIC analysis predicted that Klf5 regulates both Mrgprd and Nppb. Knockdown of Klf5 \nor Runx1 in DRG neurons reduced Mrgprd expression, with no observed mutual regulation between \nKlf5 and Runx1. Klf5 conditional knockout mice exh ibited reduced scratching in response to β-\nalanine, chloroquine, and N-met LTD4. Furthermore, Klf5 alleviated chronic itching in an allergic \ncontact dermatitis model. The absence of Klf5 impaired calcium responses of DRG neurons to β-\nalanine, chloroquine, N-met LTD4, and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC).  Conclusion Klf5 plays a \ncritical role in regulating the development and differentiation of two types of pruriceptive neurons \nin the DRG, which are represented by the Mrgprd and Nppb, and also modulates the itch response \nbehavior in mice. \n \nKeywords: Dorsal root ganglia; Neuron development; Itch", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051414301982.pdf"}, {"title": "Oxygen supply-optimized hydrogel based on stem cell therapy for neuroprosthetic treatment after craniocerebral injury", "text": "Oxygen supply-optimized hydrogel based on stem cell therapy \nfor neuroprosthetic treatment after craniocerebral injury \nQiang Xin1，Haifeng Wang1,* \n1Department of neurosurgery, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China \n*Corresponding author \nE-mail: hfwang@jlu.edu.cn \nCerebral edema occurs after traumatic brain injury ( TBI), which can lead to an increase in \nintracranial pressure.

In this study, we investigated the effects of  DA on the \nspontaneous simple spike (SS) activity of Purkinje cells ( PCs) using in vivo  cell-attached \nrecordings and pharmacological methods in urethane-anesthetized mice. Methods Adult Kunming \nmice (6 -8 weeks old) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of urethane. PCs were \nidentified through characteristic firing patterns  of regular simple spikes (SS) interspersed with \nirregular complex spikes (CS). The cell -attached recordings were performed using an \nAxopatch-200B amplifier under current clamp conditions. Immunofluorescence staining was used \nto localize DA receptor expression in the cerebellum.  Results  Cerebellar surface application o f \nDA reduced spontaneous SS firing rate in PCs (IC50 = 9.6 μM) and increased the coefficient of \nvariation (CV) ( P<0.05), demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition. The effect of DA on \nthe frequency and CV of spontaneous SS discharge in PCs was mediated by D1 receptors (D1R), \nbut not D2 receptors  (D2R). Pharmacological D1R  activation mimic ked DA  by inducing the \nreduction of the frequency of spontaneous SS discharge in PCs, accompanied by a significant \nincrease in CV  (P<0.05). The results suggest  that DA regulated the spontaneous SS discharge \nactivity of PCs in the mouse cerebellar cortex depending on GABAergic synaptic transmission \nrather than excitatory glutam atergic synaptic transmission.

The four channels spiral \nsynchronously and rotate in one direction, and the K+ transport mode is passive and one-way, without \nATP dependence, which is different from the previous “paddle”, “propeller” and “revolving door” \nmodels.The mechanism of action is that the repulsive force formed by K+ and positively charged \namino acids in th e spiral of the channel pushes the “wind teeth” back and the “windmill” rotates, \nwhile the size of the aperture of K+ channel changes with the speed of the “windmill” and determines \nthe “opening” and “closing” of the channel hole.Based on the K+ channel “origami windmill” model, \nit can be inferred that there are at least two types of channels on the cell membrane,  one type of \nchannel is the entrance E channel, such as the “origami windmill” model, at least one E channel per \ncell;The other type of channel is exit L channel, whose structure only transforms between “open” and \n“closed” conformations. It is a passive unidirectional channel with more than one L channel per cell. \nWith respect to K+, the pore diameter of the two channels is greater than or equal to K+ diameter in \n“open” and smaller than K+ diameter in “close”, while the pore diameter is smaller than K+ diameter \nbut not smaller than Na + diameter in “close”.

A de novo mutation (c.C316G>A, p.A106T) in the human GABA type-A receptor γ2 subunit gene (GABRG2) has been recurrently identified in patients with DEE. In this study, we generated a knock-in mouse model replicating the human GABRG2(A106T) variation (Gabrg2+/A105T in mouse). Gabrg2+/A105T mice displayed early mortality, spontaneous seizures, and enhanced seizure susceptibility. These mice also exhibited behavioral abnormalities observed in DEEs, including impaired spatial learning and memory, depression, and increased anxiety. Reduced γ2 subunit protein expression was detected in the hippocampus of mutant mice, but not other brain regions. Notably, hippocampal transcriptome profiling provided evidence of neuroinflammation, and histopathological analysis demonstrated increased microgliosis prior to seizure onset. These findings indicate that neuroinflammatory processes, a major theme in acquired epilepsies, may potentially exacerbate epileptogenesis in Gabrg2+/A105T mice. The knock-in mouse model serves as a critical platform for evaluating anti-inflammatory therapies as adjunct treatments for drug-resistant DEEs.

Conventional analgesics, particularly opioids, often fail to provide sustained relief due to tolerance and adverse \neffects such as hyperalgesia, nausea, and constipation. The voltage -gated proton channel Hv1 has been implica ted in \ninflammatory pain and opioid -induced tolerance, but its role in BCP remains unclear. This study investigates the \ninvolvement of Hv1 in BCP  and evaluates the analgesic and bone -protective potential of its inhibition.  \nMethods: \nA murine bone cancer pain (BCP) model was established by intrafemoral injection of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. \nMechanical and thermal pain sensitivities were assessed using von Frey and thermal tests on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 post-\ninjection. On day  15, X -ray imaging evaluated bone destruction, while immunofluorescence and RNAscope assays \ndetermined Hv1 expression in the L4 –L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord, and femur. To examine the analgesic \neffects of Hv1 inhibition, mice were treated with the selective Hv1 inhibitor YHV98-4 or subjected to Hv1 gene knockout, \nfollowed by behavioral pain assessments, micro -CT imaging, and histological analysis of the femur. Mechanistic \ninvestigations included qRT -PCR analysis of inflammatory mediators (e.g.,  CXCL1, CCL2, IL -1β) in DRG tissues, \nexamination of Hv1 expression in preosteoclasts and RAW264.7 macrophages, and TRAP staining to evaluate the impact \nof Hv1 inhibition on RANKL -induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro.  \nResults: \nHv1 expression was elevated in the ipsilateral DRG and tumor -bearing femur of BCP mice. Inhibition or knockout of \nHv1 significantly reduced pain behaviors and bone destruction. Mechanistically, Hv1 inhibition suppressed inflammatory \nmediator release in DRG  and inhibited osteoclast formation in vitro.  \n \nConclusions: \nHv1 plays a key role in bone cancer pain by modulating inflammatory responses and osteoclast activity.

However, recent studies have found hundreds of \nmRNAs in axons, suggesting that presynaptic PS controls neural communication. Here we show \nthat local PS in axons of pyramidal cells sustains neurotransmission in mouse visual cortex.  \nNeurotransmission was suppressed within minutes after PS blockade. To localize the PS \nneed, we selectively manipulate pre- or postsynaptic neurons with intracellular drug loading. We \nfound synaptic response deficits and exaggerated paired-pulse ratio after presynaptic blockade \nwith M7 cap analog, indicating synaptic release is boosted by presynaptic PS. Using 2-photon laser \nmicrosurgery to sever axon from cell body, we showed that axonal PS sustained neurotransmitter \nrelease. To understanding the dynamics o f axonal PS, we live imaged RNA localization and \ntranslation. Taking advantage of FAM-puromycin incorporation as proxy for PS, we captured the \nrapid and localized activity -dependent mRNA translation at presynaptic boutons. Interestingly, \nendogenous RNA revealed persistent and discrete docking patterns at individual presynaptic sites, \nsuggesting bouton-specific regulation. In agreement, PS sustained neurotransmission at synapses \nfrom excitatory cells to excitatory cells, but not to inhibitory cells.  Axonal PS can therefore fine -\ntune excitatory: inhibitory balance. We also found that axonal PS is required in high- but not low-\nfrequency neurotransmission, suggesting a role in high-fidelity information transfer and memory \nformation.

This study aimed to explore the role of Dectin-1 in visceral hypersensitivity\nand elucidate the impact of Dectin-1 activity on the function of transient receptor potential\nvanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). Visceral hypersensitivity model was established by the intracolonic\nadministration of TNBS in the male mice.

The expression of Dectin-1 was upregulated in the DRG\nand colon of TNBS-treated mice. Colocalization of Dectin-1 and TRPV1 was observed in DRG\nneurons.

This study aims to understand the photovoltaic activation mechanisms of \nremaining degenerated retinal circuits, and attempts to enhance metrics of prosthetic vision by \nexploitation of such mechanisms . Methods A single -cell level multi-modal database was \nconstructed by dye-filled patch clamp recording  under drug application  and dendritic field \nreconstruction based on immunohistochemistry  (IHC) staining. Correlations between different \ndimensions of circuitry properties such as intrinsic electrophysiological properties (both normal and \npathological), photovoltaic responses, effects of different neurostimulants and structural features  \nwere measured to excavate similarities and differences compared to those in normal retina. We \ntherefore intervened in potential pathways revealed by such correlations and evaluated the results \nby different visual stimulation protocols. Results ON/OFF property is largely preserved in rd1 -\ncDTA blind mouse RGCs since electrophysiological clustering coincided with z -axis dendritic \ndistribution. Receptive field size is also preserved since electric receptive field (eRF) sizes matched \nreconstructed dendritic field (DF) sizes. Although most of the OFF responses to light were lost due \nto photoreceptor loss and BPC remodeling, a small proportion of OFF response endured by lateral \ninhibition pathways. Spontaneous oscillation appeared in rd1 -cDTA RGCs as in other RP disease \nmodels and corrupted eRF integrity as previously reported , but primarily through subthreshold \noscillation frequency instead of subthreshold power spectrum density or spontaneous action \npotentials.

T his study aims to elucidate the functional role s of \nenkephalins and coexisting neurotransmitters in enkephalinergic neurons of the cortex. Methods (1) \nTransgenic reporter mice combined with histological techniques  were employed to trace \nenkephalinergic neurons in the cortex.  (2) Fluorescent in situ hybridization was to verify the co -\nexpression of enkephalins and neurotransmitters . (3) A multidisciplinary approach encompassing \nviral injections, behavioral paradigms, pharmacology and whole -cell patch -clamp \nelectrophysiology was implemented to investigate the functional roles of co- released enkephalins \nand neurotransmitters. Results (1) Enkephalinergic neurons are densely expressed in the \norbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and predominantly localized to cortical layers II/III.  (2) OFC \nenkephalinergic neurons co- express proenkephalin mRNA and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 \nmRNA. (3) Activation of OFC enkephalinergic neurons alleviates allodynia and depressi on-like \nbehaviors induced by the chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. (4) The analgesic effects \nare mediated through local enkephalin release acting on δ -opioid receptors and μ-opioid receptors \nwithin the OFC. Conclusion OFC enkephalinergic neurons mediate analgesi c effects  via local \nenkephalin release, while their antidepressive effects may involve glutamate release through extra-\nOFC axonal projections.  \nKeywords: enkephalinergic neurons; orbitofrontal cortex; δ-opioid receptors/μ-opioid receptors; \nallodynia", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051319551640.pdf"}, {"title": "Visual Reconstruction Based on Temporal Encoding Information of Visual Cortex Neurons", "text": "Visual Reconstruction Based on Temporal Encoding Information \nof Visual Cortex Neurons \nQing-Y uan CHEN1, Shan-Shan JIA2, Zhao-Fei YU2, Jian K.

It is broadly characterized as histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch. Chronic itch (mostly nonhistaminergic itch) severely impairs the quality of life in patients. However, the treatment remains limited due to incomplete understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. A previous study demonstrated that Tmem45b is expressed in isolectin B4-labeling nonpeptidergic neurons and system knockout of Tmem45b resulted in the significant alleviation of inflammation-induced mechanical pain. However, the potential role of Tmem45b in itch sensation has not been explored. We identified that Tmem45b was contained in natriuretic peptide type B (Nppb)-, mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member A3 (Mrgpra3)-, and Mrgprd-positive DRG neurons, which are associated with itch sensation. Tmem45b conditional knockout (cKO) mice exhibited reduced scratching behavior in response to β-alanine, and increased scratching in response to chloroquine. Notably, Tmem45b cKO alleviated chronic itch in both atopic dermatitis and dry skin models. Furthermore, Tmem45b cKO impaired the calcium response to β-alanine and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) in dissociated DRG neurons. At the subcellular level, Tmem45b was localized to the trans-Golgi membrane. Its loss led to significant downregulation of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase 1 (Serca1), impairing calcium storage capacity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Inhibition of Serca1 in DRG neurons reduced intracellular calcium release triggered by β-alanine and chloroquine. Together, our data suggest that Tmem45b deficiency could attenuate nonhistaminergic itch response and impair the ER calcium regulatory activity. These findings suggest a new target for treating chronic itch.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051409312428.pdf"}, {"title": "Bed nuclei of stria terminalis neurons mediate anxiety and depression like behaviors", "text": "Bed nuclei of stria terminalis  neurons mediate anxiety and \ndepression like behaviors \nYue Chang1, Zhizhe Zhang1, Tingting Liu1, Guohong Wang1, Yuqiu Zhang1* \n \n1\nInstitutes of Brain Science , State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology and MOE \nFrontiers Center for Brain Science, Fudan University, 131 Dong An Road, Shanghai 200032, \nChina \n \n*Corresponding author \nE-mail: yuqiuzhang@fudan.edu.cn, ninglu@fudan.edu.cn,  \n \nAbstract: Objective Patients often suffer from neuropathic pain (NP) with mental diseases \nsuch as anxiety and depression.

Current treatments are limited in effectiveness and lack\nclearly defined biological targets or intervention mechanisms. High-fat diets (HFD) have been\nshown to alleviate feeding deficits associated with anorexia nervosa (AN); however, the\nunderlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The norepinephrine (NE) system, particularly locus\ncoeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) neurons, plays a crucial role in appetite regulation and feeding\nsuppression. This study aimed to investigate whether LC-NE neurons contribute to the therapeutic\neffects of HFD on AN by focusing on their connectivity with the medial septum (MS) and\nevaluating the potential involvement of NE receptor subtype Adra1a in AN pathophysiology.\nMethods We used the activity-based anorexia (ABA) mouse model, which mimics key clinical\nfeatures of human AN. To elucidate neural mechanisms, fiber photometry recording, behavioral\ntests, optogenetics, and chemogenetics were applied to systematically examine the physiological\nand pathological alterations within the LC NE-MS neural circuitry associated with feeding\nbehaviors and emotional regulation. Additionally, pharmacological approaches targeting NE\nreceptors (Adra1a) were employed to explore their therapeutic potential within this neural\npathway.

However, whether and how SI\naffects the empathy development remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SI-treated observer\nmice exhibited impaired contagious pain and other-directed prosocial behaviors, such as\nallogrooming and allolicking, when they are allowed to interact with the cagemates experiencing\nsevere inflammatory pain. Mechanistically, we revealed an indispensable role of glutamatergic\nprojections from ventromedial thalamus (VM) to orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in mediating both\npain contagion and prosocial actions. SI induces profound hypoexcitability of OFC glutamatergic\nneurons and blunted excitatory synaptic transmission of the VM-OFC circuit.

Here, we identified a hypothalamus-to-brainstem neural circuit through which neurons expressing neuropeptide Y1 receptor (NPY1R) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) mediate stress-induced feeding suppression. Methods Using viral tracing, calcium imaging, opto- and chemogenetic approaches in mice, we mapped a PVN-to-brainstem circuit involved in appetite regulation. Results Anatomical analyses revealed that PVN NPY1R neurons project to the dorsal vagal complex, particularly the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), forming synaptic connections with cholinergic (ChAT) neurons. Fiber photometry recordings demonstrated that acute stress robustly activates NPY1R neurons. Activation of these neurons or their terminals in the DMV significantly suppressed food intake, while inhibition of this pathway reversed stress-induced feeding suppression. Moreover, stimulation of the PVN–brainstem circuit evoked anxiety-like behaviors, indicating a coordinated modulation of feeding and emotional responses under stress.

In this process, the\ncoordinated control of neural activity plays an important role. Due to the complexity of the female\nestrus cycle, previous studies mostly focused on the males, but the neural basis of female sexual\nbehaviors is relatively few. One of the well-known brain regions involve in female sexual behavior\nis the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl), and 50 % of which\nexpress Esr1, a sex hormonal receptor. Within the VMHvl, Cholecystokinin A receptor (Cckar) is\nexpressed in a lateral subset of VMHvlEsr1 cells. Cckar is a receptor for cholecystokinin (CCK) and\nCCK functions as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system. Further, optogenetic inhibition of\nVMHvl Cckar neurons significantly reduced the duration of female lordosis behavior. The lordosis\nbehavior is a female’s gesture when a male innitiates mounting, which reflects female sexual\nreceptivity. The optogenetics results demonstrate that VMHvl Cckar neurons are the key controllers\nof female sexual receptivity. However, the mechanism of VMHvl Cckar neurons modulating female\nsexual behaviors remains unknown. The present study is to explore whether VMHvl Cckar cells\ncontrol female sexual behaviors by sensing upstream CCK peptide release and further mechanism.\nMethods The techniques of chemogenetics, optogenetics, cannula infusion, fiber photometry, slice\nrecording and mini-two-photon imaging were adopted.

In a novel flexible\ndecision-making paradigm, we tested how mice use contextual evidence to reverse choices of a\nsubset of trials upon abrupt rule switches. We found that if context-guided, the sound proportions\nin non-reversing trials is prevalent, displaying strong contextual evidence, mice showed faster\nchoice updating and better rule inference (e.g. even making no error after rule switch). In contrast,\nin lack of contextual information, with equal proportions of non-reversing sound types, mice made\nmore persistent errors upon rule changes, indicating a facilitating role of contextual evidence in\ncognitive flexibility. We next asked which brain areas are essential for context-dependent rule\nupdating: provided with context, posterior parietal cortex (PPC) inhibition selectively slows mice\ndown in rule updating speed, which remains unchanged without a context; however, inhibition of\nanterior cingulate cortex (ACC) significantly impairs rule updating in both conditions. This leads\nto our hypotheses that PPC is specifically involved in integrating context and rule knowledge,\nwhereas ACC may compute the error-based information useful for general rule updating.\nTwo-photon calcium imaging then revealed a functional relationship between contextual evidence\nstrength and rule encoding in PPC layer 2/3 neurons, confirming that PPC can track contextual\nchanges to inform rule, while such relationship is less common in ACC. Instead, ACC neurons\nencode multiple task-related variables, including sound type, choice, and behavioral outcome,\ntogether contributing to flexible rule switching. In summary, we highlight that PPC and ACC are\nboth required for rule inference ， in which PPC is selectively involved in utilizing context\ninformation, implying important and complementary circuit-level mechanism of rule computation.\nKeywords: cognitive flexibility; flexible decision-making; rule inference; neural circuits", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051412190920.pdf"}, {"title": "The distinctive roles of histamine H1 receptor in the subregions of paraventricular thalamus in approach-avoidance conflict behavior", "text": "The distinctive roles of histamine H 1 receptor in the subregions \nof paraventricular thalamus in approach -avoidance conflict \nbehavior \nYi-Ting Ping1, Yi-Xin Xu1, Zhong Chen2, Wei-Wei Hu1,* \n \n1Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou \n310058, China \n2Key Laboratory of Neuropharmacology and Translational Medicine of Zhejiang Province, \nZhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China \n \n*Corresponding author \n \nE-mail: huww@zju.edu.cn \n \nApproach-avoidance conflict (AAC) occurs when a target object or goal elicits both attraction and \nrepulsion, while abnormal AAC behavior is associated with various psychiatric and neurological \ndiseases. Many reports proved that the paraventricular thalamus  (PVT) is closely related to AAC \nbehavior, the regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Previous studies found abundant histaminergic \nneuronal projections and rich expression of histamine H 1 receptor (H1R) in PVT. Therefore, the \nstudy is to explore the role of H 1R in PVT in AAC behavior. We found that deficiency of H1R in \nglutamatergic neurons in aPVT biases behavior towards food seeking, while deficiency of H1R in \npPVT improves avoidance behavior. Deficiency of H1R in glutamatergic neurons in PVT inhibits \nneuronal activation, alters neuronal calcium activity, influencing AAC behavior. Histaminergic \nneurons projections to aPVT and pPVT are partially segregated, regulating AAC behavior through \nH1R.

Recent research shows that ASD symptoms are linked to\nbrain-wide circuit changes and multi-organ interactions. The Shank3 gene, encoding a key\nsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in ASD, is not only highly expressed in the brain but also\nin cardiac tissue, suggesting the potential for multi-organ consequences following its dysfunction.\nHowever, it’s unclear if Shank3 absence impacts cardiac structure/function and if such changes\naffect brain-heart interactions. Methods: We used Shank3-/- mice as an ASD model and confirmed\ncardiac abnormalities via echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG). We then mapped the\nneural circuits regulating cardiac function and ASD symptoms using radiotelemetry, viral tracing,\ncalcium imaging, and optogenetics. Finally, we used transgenic mice to knockdown/re-express\nSHANK3 in cardiac tissue to study heart-to-brain effects in ASD. Results: Shank3-/- mice exhibit\nsignificant cardiac structural and functional impairments. Cardiac abnormalities induce\nhyper-activation in autism-related brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and\nperiaqueductal gray (PAG), through abnormal interoceptive pathways. Circuit-level analyses\nrevealed two top-down circuits that are involved in the regulation of abnormal cardiac function\nand distinct core symptoms in Shank3-/- mice. The first circuit is the PFCVglut2-ECTVglut2-PAG\ncircuit and the PAGVglut2-RVMM circuit, which are involved in the regulation of cardiac function\nand repetitive behaviors. The second circuit is the PFCVglut2-LHAVGAT-PAG circuit and the\nPAGVglut2-NTS circuit, which are involved in the regulation of cardiac function and social deficits.\nConclusion: Overall, our study explores the circuit mechanism underlying brain-driven regulation\nof cardiac dysfunction in autism, revealing how disruptions in neural pathways contribute to both\nautism-related cardiac impairments and core behavioral symptoms.\nKey words: autism, heart, brain, stereotyped behavior, social deficit, Shank3", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051412503427.pdf"}, {"title": "Hierarchical attractor network drives history bias in zebrafish", "text": "Hierarchical attractor network drives history bias in zebrafish \n \nShan Zhao1#, Heying Shan1#, Xiao Liu2, Yu  Q ia n3, Yu Mu1* \n \n1Institute of Neuroscience, State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Center for Excellence in Brain \nScience and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China \n2IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Academy \nfor Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China \n3The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 78705, the United States \n \n# Equal contribution  \n \n* Corresponding author  \n \n E-mail: my@ion.ac.cn \n \nAbstract: History bias serves as an adaptive strategy in natural environments characterized by long-\nterm regularities, yet its underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain elusive.

Peripheral nerve injury is one of the primary causes of neuropathic pain, with its \npathogenic mechanisms involving aberrant neurotransmission and alterations in the activity and \nconnectivity of canonical pain-processing nuclei. Our previous studies have shown that peripheral \nnerve injury induces the generation of SNIIC neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These \nneurons exhibit elevated expression of genes associated with central sensitization and enhanced \nsynaptic transmission, suggesting their critical role  in the development of neuropathic pain \nfollowing nerve injury . However, the role of SNIIC  neurons in the functional and connectivity \nchanges of the brain after peripheral nerve injury  and the mechanisms involved remain unclear . \nThus, this study aims to elucidate the circuit mechanisms by which SNIIC neurons regulate \nneuropathic pain and its associated comorbid emotional disorders. \nMethods＆Results Chemogenetic silencing of SNIIC neuronal activity effectively alleviated \nnerve injury-induced mechanical allodynia, whereas their activation evoked spontaneous pain-like \nbehaviors in mice. Blockade of SNIIC synaptic transmission prevented the transition to chronic \nneuropathic pain and alleviated associated affective comorbidities. Anterograde trans-polysynaptic \ntracing using herpes simplex virus  (HSV) revealed strengthened connectivity between SNIIC  \nneurons and multiple canonical pain-processing nuclei. Subsequent chemogenetic and optogenetic \nmanipulations further confirmed that the neuronal activity of these nuclei is regulated by SNIIC  \nneurons. \nConclusion Our findings suggest that SNIIC neurons drive the initiation and progression of \nneuropathic pain and its associated affective comorbidities by modulating the function of their \nderived neural networks. \n \n \n \nKeywords: Neuropathic pain, dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerve injury, neural circuits", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051415580364.pdf"}, {"title": "MPL-Pth2 Neurons respond to Aversive Stimuli: Calcium Dynamics and Neural Circuit Mapping", "text": "MPL-Pth2 Neurons respond to Aversive Stimuli: Calcium \nDynamics and Neural Circuit Mapping \n \nZixu Zhang1,#, Chuanyao Sun2, #, Shuyan Geng1,2, Shengru Hu1,2, Haoyu Sun1,2, Tianxiang Xu1,2, \nZixuan Lei1, and Wei Xie2, *, Mingdao Mu1,2,* \n \n1School of Medicine, Southeast University, 87 Dingjiaqiao Road, Nanjing, P R.

We found that CSDS mice display disrupted\nexploration-defense balance, with heightened avoidance, reduced exploration, and longer time\nspent in the home chamber during a predator threat task. Interestingly, under reward-conflict\nconditions, these mice showed enhanced success in obtaining food despite ongoing threats,\nindicating altered motivational processing. Using fiber photometry, patch-clamp recordings, and\nbehavioral assays, we identified the posterior lateral septum (pLS) as a key region activated during\nexploratory transitions in control mice, crucial for decision-making between exploration and\ndefense. Further analysis of pLS activity and connectivity with regions like the hippocampus,\nhypothalamus, medial amygdala, and mammillary bodies revealed its role as an integrative hub for\nemotional and motivational signals. In CSDS mice, pLS neurons exhibited abnormal firing\npatterns and calcium dynamics during behavior, corresponding with their altered behavior. These\nfindings demonstrate that chronic stress disrupts pLS function, contributing to maladaptive\nbehavioral responses.

Studies using animal models have shown that\npaternal cocaine use and highly motivated drug-seeking behavior are important determinants of\noffspring addiction susceptibility. However, the key molecules contributing to offspring addiction\nsusceptibility are currently unclear. The motivation for cocaine-seeking behavior in offspring of\nmale rats was compared between those whose fathers self-administered cocaine (SA) and those\nwho were yoked with them and received non-contingent cocaine administrations (Yoke). We\nfound that paternal experience with cocaine-seeking behavior, but not direct cocaine exposure,\ncould lead to increased lever-pressing behavior in male F1 offspring. This effect was observed\nwithout significant changes to the dose-response relationship. The transcriptomes of ventral\ntegmental area (VTA) in offspring were analyzed under both naive state and after\nself-administration training. Specific transcriptomic changes in response to paternal\ncocaine-seeking experiences were found, which mainly affected biological processes such as\nsynaptic connections and receptor signaling pathways. Through joint analysis of these candidate\ngenes and parental drug-seeking motivation scores, we found that gamma-aminobutyric acid\nreceptor subunit gamma-3 (Gabrg3) was in the hub position of the drug-seeking\nmotivation-related module network and highly correlated with parental drug-seeking motivation\nscores. The downregulation of Gabrg3 expression, caused by paternal motivational\ncocaine-seeking, mainly occurred in GABAergic neurons in the VTA. Furthermore,\ndown-regulating GABAergic Gabrg3 in VTA resulted in an increase in cocaine-seeking behavior\nin the Yoke F1 group. This down-regulation also reduced transcriptome differences between the\nYoke and SA groups, affecting processes related to synaptic formation and neurotransmitter\ntransmission. Taken together, we propose that paternal cocaine-seeking behavior, rather than\ndirect drug exposure, significantly influences offspring addiction susceptibility through the\ndownregulation of Gabrg3 in GABAergic neurons of the VTA, highlighting the importance of\nunderstanding specific molecular pathways in the intergenerational inheritance of addiction\nvulnerability.\nKeywords: Molecular neuroscience, Epigenetics and behaviour, Epigenetics and plasticity,\nAddiction", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060314470722.pdf"}, {"title": "The interhemispheric amygdala-accumbens circuit encodes negative valence in mice", "text": "The interhemispheric amygdala-accumbens circuit encodes\nnegative valence in mice\nZhen Tian\nFudan University\nThe structurally symmetric mammalian brain hemispheres are\ninterconnected by commissural axons across the midline.

This study examines the roles of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and lateral septum \n(LS), two critical regions implicated in the regulation of emotional and behavioral processes. \nChronic exposure to stress has been shown to accelerate the development of anxiety and \ndepression, with deficits in prefrontal control leading to abnormal activation in the LS and \nresultant behavioral abnormalities. Although the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) \nfor alleviating anxiety have been validated in clinical studies, the underlying neurocircuitry \nremains poorly understood, particularly regarding its modulation of the mPFC to LS \nneurocircuitry. Methods We established a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model to \ninvestigate the anxiolytic effects of EA, employing behavioral assessments, immunofluorescence, \nprotein immunoblotting, chemical genetics, and electrophysiological techniques to determine the \noptimal frequency and acupoint pairing for EA treatment. Results  Our findings revealed that CRS \nsignificantly increased anxiety -like behaviors in open field and elevated plus -maze tests, while \ndepression-like behaviors remained unchanged. Notably, 2 Hz EA applied at the Neiguan and \nTaichong acupoints effectively alleviated anxiety-like behaviors without impacting depression-like \nbehaviors. Immunofluorescence and patch clamp recording experiments demonstrated an increase \nin c-FOS expression in CaMKⅡ-positive neurons within the mPFC, alongside heightened neuronal \nexcitability as indicated by increased numbers of action potentials and sEPSCs. EA treatment \nmitigated the CRS-induced excitability. Additionally, chemogenetic activation of mPFC CaMK Ⅱ-\npositive neurons reversed the anxiolytic effects of EA, while their inhibition produced effects \nsimilar to EA treatment. Activation of the mPFC\nCaMKⅡ+-LS negated the anxiolytic effects of EA, \nwhereas its inhibition elicited anxiolytic responses comparable to those observed with EA. \nConclusion In conclusion, 2 Hz low -frequency electroacupuncture represents an optimal \nintervention for alleviating anxiety -like behaviors in CRS model mice. The anxiolytic effects of \nEA are mediated by the inhibition of CaMKⅡ-positive neuronal activation in the mPFC, leading to \na reduction in excitatory output to the LS.

In this work, we combined neural circuit tracing,\nmulti-channel electrophysiological recording, two-photon Calcium imaging, and\noptogenetic manipulation to investigate the neural circuit mechanism of Gamma\nsynchrony in facilitating associative memory encoding in terms of correlation and\ncausality.\nKeywords: Gamma oscillation; LEC; associative learning; dopamine", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25050714512785.pdf"}, {"title": "Learning-dependent motor cortical plasticity is influenced by peripheral motor feedback", "text": "Learning-dependent motor cortical plasticity is influenced by \nperipheral motor feedback \nWen DAI \nInstitute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, \nShanghai, 200433, China \n \nE-mail: daiwen@fudan.edu.cn \n \nAbstract: Objective Motor learning alters synaptic plasticity in the primary motor cortex \n(M1) and induces long-term potentiation (LTP) in the M1.

Both the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are essential \nfor organizing associative memory, with recent research highlighting their complementary roles: the hippocampus \nencode more specific associations, while the OFC facilitates generalization of similar associations. Despite this, \ntheir causal interdependence—particularly how dysfunction in one region impacts the other—remains poorly \nunderstood. Here, we trained head-restrained mice to learn four ‘odor-outcome’ sequence pairs composed of \nseveral task variables—the past and current odor cues, sequence structure of ‘cue-outcome’ arrangement, and the \nexpected outcome—and performed calcium imaging in these mice throughout learning, combined with \npharmacological lesions. Our results revealed that CA1 lesions significantly enhanced outcome prediction \nrepresentation in the OFC, manifested as high generalization across sequences, epochs, and trials. In contrast, OFC \nlesions mildly impaired the generalization of long-delay sequences in the CA1, indicating an asymmetric \ninteraction between the two regions. These findings suggest that under normal conditions, a hierarchical regulatory \nmechanism may exist between the two regions: the CA1 provides bottom-up context-specific information to \nconstrain excessive generalization of outcome-related associations in the OFC, while the OFC delivers top-down \noutcome prediction signals to promote generalization representation in the CA1. Taken together, these results \nsuggest that the hippocampus and OFC work in a complementary manner to organize acquired associative \nstructures, exerting opposing roles in each other’s representation and balancing the interplay between \ndiscrimination and generalization in cognitive maps. \nKey words: associative structure, hippocampus, orbitofrontal, context, sequence, prediction, generalization, \nsplitting, conjunctive code, calcium imaging", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25050820294412.pdf"}, {"title": "Perceptual learning boosts sensory recruitment of V1 and offloads involvement of IPS0 in working memory", "text": "Perceptual learning boosts sensory recruitment of V1 and offloads involvement of IPS0 in working memory  Siyuan CHENG1, Yiran GE1, Nihong CHEN 2,3,4 *  1 Department of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China 2 Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences (South China Normal University), Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, 510631, China 3 School of Psychology, Center for Studies of Psychological Application, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Mental Health and Cognitive Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China 4 Philosophy and Social Science Laboratory of Reading and Development in Children and Adolescents (South China Normal University), Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, 510631, China  *Corresponding author  E-mail: nihongch@m.scnu.edu.cn  Abstract:  The representation of information in sensory and working memory (WM) relies on distinct neural codes. While previous studies suggest that sensory inputs are gradually transformed into mnemonic codes during memory formation, it remains unclear how perceptual training shapes this process, and how WM representations are distributed across sensory and post-sensory cortices. To address these questions, we trained human subjects on a visual motion discrimination task and measured their neural representations in a delayed motion discrimination task using fMRI. Five days of training on motion discrimination led to feature-specific improvements. Critically, multi-voxel representational dynamics revealed a dual change after learning: during WM retention, information in V1 became more aligned with sensory coding, while mnemonic representation in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS0) reduced. Representational similarity analysis showed increased alignment between WM maintenance and sensory representations in V1, demonstrating stronger retention of sensory traces. Moreover, the magnitude of this V1 alignment predicted individual improvements in WM precision, directly linking perceptual–mnemonic convergence to behavioral gains. Our findings suggest that perceptual learning reallocates neural resources along the visual‑parietal hierarchy, bolstering the high-fidelity representation in the early visual cortex and consequently relieving the parietal cortex of mnemonic load.

Pattern completion refers to the retrieval of a complete memory from partial\nor degraded cues and plays a key role in the accurate recall of episodic memories.The\nhippocampal CA3 region is considered central to this process, as its dense recurrent connections\namong pyramidal neurons form an auto-associative architecture resembling a Hopfield network,\nwhich theoretically supports stable retrieval of stored patterns.However, whether the in vivo\nneural dynamics of the CA3 network exhibit stable states akin to Hopfield models remains to be\nempirically validated.The specific neural activity patterns of the CA3 network during pattern\ncompletion remain poorly understood.

Simultaneously,\nin vivo multi-channel recordings were used to examine neural coding properties of CA3 across\nvarying difficulty levels.Results (1)A touchscreen-based pairwise discrimination task was\nimplemented to establish a quantitative behavioral paradigm for assessing pattern completion.As\nimage-pair similarity decreased progressively across five sessions (C0 to C4), mice showed a\ngradual increase in discrimination index, suggesting improved pattern completion.(2)c-Fos\nimmunofluorescence revealed consistent recruitment of the CA3 region across difficulty levels,\nwith no significant differences in expression between sessions.In vivo recordings revealed\nheterogeneous CA3 neuronal responses during the critical window from image onset to correct\ntouch: some neurons responded around image presentation, others near the correct touch, and\nsome to both events.The proportion of responsive neurons remained stable across the five\nsessions.This study is the first to perform in vivo ensemble recordings of CA3 neurons during a\nvalidated pattern completion paradigm.

While theta -\nfrequency oscillations (4–12 Hz) in regions like the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are \nknown to support fear and extinction learning, how distinct theta subbands coordinate \nacross circuits remains unclear. Here, we recorded local field potentials across the \nBLA–ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) –lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) circuit \nduring fear conditioning, extinct ion, and memory retrieval in mice. Fear learning \ninduced a network -wide shift toward low -theta (~4 Hz), while extinction partially \nrestored high-theta (~8 Hz), producing a bimodal theta profile during retrieval. These \nrhythms tracked behavior: 4 -Hz power r ose during freezing, and 8 -Hz power during \nactive periods. The 4:8 -Hz ratio predicted individual extinction performance, with \nprolonged freezing linked to sustained 4 -Hz activity, and longer non -freezing bouts \nlinked to increased 8 -Hz, especially in vCA1 a nd LEC. Mice failing extinction \nmaintained elevated 4 -Hz power. Environmental context modulated theta differently \nacross regions: vCA1 and LEC showed increased 8 -Hz in novel contexts, while BLA \ntheta was broadly suppressed. Coherence analyses revealed fear conditioning enhanced \n4-Hz coupling in BLA–vCA1 and BLA–LEC pathways; extinction reduced this and \nmodestly increased 8-Hz coherence. These shifts aligned with behavioral states: 4 -Hz \ncoherence rose before freezing, and 8 -Hz during movement.

Recent research has  discovered a phenomenon named \"representational drift\", \nwherein hippocampal activity patterns undergo gradual changes over days and weeks, even in an \nunchanging environment. While existing explanations focus on spatial memory robustness through \na mobile yet stable internal geometry, it remains unclear how to compensate for such mobility and \nwhether these mechanisms extend to more general non-spatial associative memory.  This study \ninvestigates how dynamic neuronal activity supports stable hippocampal representations over time, \nspecifically addressing non- spatial associative learning.  Methods Using two -photon calcium \nimaging, we longitudinally tracked the activity of the same neurons across multiple days from head-\nfixed mice , performing an odor -outcome associative learning task. By group-level independent \ncomponent analysis  (ICA), raw neuronal activities were  decomposed into stable task-related \ncomponents and dynamic neuronal weights . Through neural decoding, network analysis , and \nGranger causality, we assessed whether a subset of more stable neurons underlies robust coding.  \nResults (1) The task geometry is consistent in population- level cross days, despite the  individual \nneuron-level drift. (2) A small subset of neurons  (13.4%) constructs the in-situ task geometry, \nsupporting long-time reading out task information .

In this study, we employed miniature two-photon calcium imaging in \nfreely behaving mice to systematically compare medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) \nneuronal activity across spatial scales. We recorded from the same neuronal \npopulations in: (1) a primary 1 m² arena, and (2) multiple smaller sub-compartments \n(50 × 50 cm or 33 × 33 cm) embedded within the larger environment. Border cells \nmaintained stable spatial representations across environmental scales, whereas head \ndirection cells exhibited context-dependent directional preferences in sub-\ncompartments.

To investigate this, we examined \nneural activity in the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex, two key brain regions \nimplicated in cognitive mapping of space and task structure, while macaque monkeys \nperformed the same spatial memory task in visually similar VR and RW \nenvironments. The monkeys learned the task efficiently in both settings but performed \nslightly better in RW. Importantly, the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex showed \nsubstantially richer spatial representations in RW compared to VR, with individual \ncells dynamically shifting their specific responses between the two conditions. Both \nregions tended to exhibit stronger generalizability in RW when reward contingency \nchanged. Cross-condition analyses revealed orthogonal population representations of \ntask state between VR and RW.

This task dependency has been studied \nby comparing neural activity under two orthogonal rules, but many of the rules we adopt in the real \nworld are often non-orthogonal, similar, and generalizable across stimuli and contexts. Here, we \ndemonstrate that the population dynamics of neuro ns in the ventrolateral PFC change as macaque \nmonkeys learn similar perceptual tasks, reflecting the process of converging on a shared decision-\nmaking process. The monkeys were trained to categorize pairs of human and monkey faces, but we \nonly used specifi c pairs of fac ial identities for training and presented novel identity pairs during \nneural recording. The monkeys partially generalized the rule to the novel pair s and then gradually \nimproved their performance to the level of the learned pairs. Meanwhile, the prefrontal population \nexhibited similar yet distinct decision -making dynamics between the stimulus pairs. This pair -\nselective signal was large when the monkeys were first introduced to a novel pair but gradually \ndecreased as they improved their perform ance. The signal amplitude depended on the number of \ntrials after pair switching, which could not be explained as mere visual selectivity. We then tested \nneural responses to many more face pairs and found that the pair -selective signal persisted \nthroughout decision formation such that the neural trajectories for different pairs ran parallel in state \nspace, potentially reflecting the outcome of using shared attractor dynamic s. Finally, recurrent \nnetworks trained to learn two similar tasks also showed a decrease in the signal distinguishing the \ntwo tasks, suggesting that this is a common representational motif when neural circuits find a shared \nsolution to two tasks.

As a \nresult, organisms possess a light-sensitive circadian pacemaker with an internal period that is close to (but \nnot exactly) 24 h. Recent studies have demonstrated that extreme T-cycles that deviate from Earth's \nphotoperiod, including T7, T20, T22.5, T27, and T30, pose physiological challenges for the mammalian \ncircadian system, affecting photoentrainment and sleep as well as physical and cognitive health. However, \nadaptability to less extreme T-cycles that deviate only slightly (<1 h) from T24 remains largely unexplored. \nOne example is the Martian photoperiod of T24.66, which is relevant to space exploration missions [Barger \net al. (2012) Sleep 35(10):1423–1435] and has received increasing attention from chronobiologists and \nastrobiologists in recent years. Here we present the first detailed investigation of the effects of T24.66 on \ncircadian (~24 h) and ultradian (<24 h) rhythms, sleep/wake patterns, and memory performance in \nlaboratory mice. Methods—A within-subjects design was used.   Male and female  C57BL/6J mice were \nhoused individually in light-tight chambers that provided artificial light/dark cycles of T24 (baseline) and \nsubsequently two weeks of T24.66 mimicking the Martian photoperiod. Home cage circadian locomotor \nactivity was monitored continuously with passive infrared (PIR) sensors  (n = 12) . Sleep w as assessed \nnoninvasively by piezoelectric sensors  (n = 4) or by cortical electroencephalography (EEG) (n = 3) . \nMemory function was assessed using the spontaneous object recognition memory task (n = 12), which is \nknown to be sensitive to hippocampal dysfunction as well as sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance. \nResults—(a) Under T24.66, the period length (τ) of daily locomotor activity increased from 23.9 h to 24.8 \nh (p < 0.001). This period lengthening caused animals’ activity midpoints to be delayed across days relative \nto T24 (p < 0.005), similar to people working under the Phoenix Mars Lander (PML) mission [Barger et al. \n(2012) Sleep 35(10):1423–1435]. (b) Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet analyses revealed an \nincrease in the power of the ultradian activity rhythm, notably at the 8-h harmonic (p < 0.001) but not at the \n6-h (p = 0.241) or 12-h harmonic (p = 0.125).

This, in turn, promotes the polarization of microglia toward an anti-inflammatory state, thereby\nimproving stroke recovery. At the molecular level, lactylation connects lactate, a metabolic byproduct, with\ncellular functions through a mechanistic pathway. This research is expected to enhance understanding of\npost-stroke pathological processes related to anaerobic glycolysis and microglia, providing new insights into the\nimmune regulation mechanisms of the central nervous system and offering novel strategies for treating\nneuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.\nMethods：C57 male mice will be used to establish a photochemical (PT) ischemic stroke model. Proteomic mass\nspectrometry will verify lactylation modifications and identify differentially modified proteins. MEK1 lactylation\nwill be confirmed via immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Mice will be divided into\nfour groups: sham surgery, stroke, post-stroke lactate intervention, and post-stroke lactate with MCT inhibitor\n7ACC2. Behavioral assessments, TTC staining, laser speckle imaging, and inflammation markers will evaluate\nrecovery. Immunoprecipitation will assess lactylation-related proteins and pathways. In vitro experiments using\nthe BV2 microglial cell line will investigate how exogenous lactate affects MEK1 lactylation, phosphorylation,\nSTAT6 activity, MAPK signaling, inflammation, and microglial polarization. Mutant virus transfection and\nco-immunoprecipitation will validate the mechanisms involved.\nResults：Proteomic mass spectrometry data showed that the majority of proteins in mice exhibited upregulated\nlactylation modifications. Notably, lysine at position 97 of the MEK1 protein displayed a 2.12-fold increase in\nlactylation modification. Molecular docking further confirmed that lactate molecules could be captured by MEK1.\nImmunoprecipitation validated that MEK1 indeed underwent lactylation, and both stroke and exogenous lactate\naddition elevated MEK1 lactylation and phosphorylation levels. After mutating the lysine at position 97, MEK1\nlactylation significantly decreased, and phosphorylation was abolished, indicating that MEK1 activation may be\nlinked to lactylation at lysine 97. Additionally, we observed an interaction between MEK1 and STAT6, and lactate\nsupplementation promoted STAT6 activation, a result also confirmed by in vitro kinase assays. In vitro\nexperiments demonstrated that lactate improved the behavioral scores of mice, reduced the infarct volume,\nenhanced blood supply, increased lactylation modification levels, decreased the secretion of inflammatory factors,\nand promoted microglial polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype.\nConclusion：Lactate promotes MEK1 lactylation and phosphorylation, which in turn activates STAT6 and drives\nmicroglial polarization toward an anti-inflammatory state, ultimately improving post-stroke outcomes.\nKey Words：Microglia; MEK1; STAT6; Lactylation; Stroke", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061313282449.pdf"}, {"title": "The role of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the spatiotemporal vascularization of the human and mouse neocortex", "text": "The role of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the\nspatiotemporal vascularization of the neocortex\nKai-Yi LIU1, Zhi-Ruo KANG1, Fang-Bing CHEN1, Q.

However, the specific mechanisms governing these glial\ncell interactions remain unclear. This study is to investigate the possible roles of IL-1β in\nmediating the interaction between Müller cells and microglia in glaucoma and the potential\nmechanisms. Methods Western blotting was employed to detect IL-1β expression in chronic\nocular hypertension (COH) retinas. The effects of IL-1β on Müller cells and microglia were\nassessed in COH mice with intravitreal injection of IL-1β in vivo and cultured primary cells in\nvitro. Functional and structural changes of COH retinas were evaluated by ERG and OCT. In\naddition, the specific mechanisms of IL-1β on Müller cells interacting with microglia were\ninvestigated through in vitro experiments. Results (1) The expression of IL1β significantly\nincreased in COH retinas. (2) After intravitreal injection of IL1β, Müller cell glial hyperplasia\nexacerbated, accompanied by increased microglial proliferation and migration, and enhanced\ninflammatory responses.

Under certain pathological conditions, microglia can inflict damage to\nneurons and astrocytes. However, the precise mechanisms underlying how activated\nmicroglia induced astrocyte atrophy and loss remain enigmatic. In this study, a\ndepression model induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is utilized. The results\nshow that CSDS induces significant anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, along with\nnotable astrocyte atrophy and apoptosis, microglial activation, and elevated levels of\nmicroglial interleukin-6 (IL-6). Subsequent studies demonstrate that IL-6 released from\nactivated microglia promotes astrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockdown of the\nP2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in microglia, which is implicated in the stress response, reduces\nstress-induced microglial activation, IL-6 release, and astrocyte apoptosis. Direct\ninhibition of microglia by minocycline corroborates these effects. The selective\nknockdown of IL-6 in microglia and IL-6 receptors in astrocytes effectively mitigates\ndepression-like behaviors and reduces astrocyte atrophy.

Their \nproliferation is stringently controlled to maintain homeosta sis. However, the mechanisms remain \nelusive. The ErbB signaling pathway is known to promote OPC proliferation and differentiation \nduring early development. Here, we found that disrupting ErbB signaling  in oligodendrocytes at \nstages from OPCs to newly -formed oligodendrocytes (NFOs)  in adult Sox10-dnEGFR mice \nincreased OPC proliferation. In contrast, direct ly stimulating ErbB activation in adult brain by \nnasal EGF administration still enhance d OPC proliferation. Notably, conditional media from \nSox10-dnEGFR NFOs promoted greater OPC proliferation in vitro than controls , suggesting that \nErbB inhibition in NFOs promotes secretion of pro -proliferative factors for OPCs . In adult \nSox10-dnEGFR mice, Sox10rtTA/+ targeted a greater number of  NFOs, inducing ErbB inhibition  \nprimarily in NFOs rather than OPCs.  RNA-Sequencing revealed unregulated FGF1 in adult  \nSox10-dnEGFR NFOs, which directly stimulated OPC proliferation . Consistently, the FGFR1 \ninhibitor blocked the enhanced OPC proliferation in adult Sox10-dnEGFR mice. These results \nsuggest that NFOs, which are consistently localized near OPCs in the adult brain, utilize the ErbB \nsignaling pathway to surveil OPC proliferation by modulating FGF1 secretion. Importantly, OPCs \nco-cultured in high-density NFO  regions exhibited a lower proliferation rate than those  in \nlow-density NFO  regions, highlighting the  oligodendrocyte lineage ’s self-monitoring and \nsurveillance mechanisms in maintaining OPC homeostasis. \n \nKey words: ErbB signaling; NFOs; FGF1; adult OPC homeostasis", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051511072094.pdf"}, {"title": "Thymectomy Selectively Enhances Social Interaction and Impairs Memory in Mice", "text": "Thymectomy Selectively Enhances Social Interaction and\nImpairs Memory in Mice\nTianxiang Xu1,2,#, Xueyang Bao1,3,4#, Haoyu Sun1,2, Chuanyao Sun2, Shengru Hu1,2, Shuyan\nGeng1,2, Wenqi Wei1, Zixu Zhang1,2, Junxu Liu1, Lixian Peng1, Wei Xie2, Mingzhu Zheng1,2,3,4∗,\nMingdao Mu1,2∗\n1School of Medicine, Southeast University, 87 Dingjiaqiao Road, Nanjing, P R.

While various stages of speech production have been associated with distinct brain areas (e.g., Broca’s area), the physiological role of breathing in speech production remains under-explored. Beyond its basic mechanical function (e.g., airflow regulation), recent evidence suggests breathing rhythms may actively coordinate with speech planning, such as the positive correlation between inhalation depth and subsequent speech envelope power. Yet whether and how breathing rhythms synchronize with and represent complex linguistic information in speech production across different timescales remains unclear. This study investigates the alignment between breathing patterns and linguistic structures during narrative speech production. Methods Participants are asked to narrate a pre-prepared story in Mandarin Chinese in a sound-proof room, while respiratory and speech signals are simultaneously recorded. Results Spectral analysis revealed distinct respiratory patterns during speech compared to rest. Critically, we found a significant coherence between the rhythms of speech production and breathing rhythms at ~0.3 Hz, alongside a consistent temporal response function linking speech envelope dynamics to respiratory activity, peaking ~390 ms before speech onset. Conclusion To conclude, these findings demonstrate that breathing patterns align with the temporal structure of sentences, suggesting an active coordination between respiratory rhythms and linguistic structures. Our results underscore breathing’s role not merely as a peripheral mechanism but as a dynamic component embedded within the neural and cognitive architecture of speech production.

While local cerebral blood \nflow (CBF) is regulated by regional neural activities via neurovascular coupling, how \nCBF is globally coordinated remains largely unclear. Leveraging in vivo whole-brain \nimaging of multiple neurovascular components in larval zebrafish, we demonstrate that \nthe locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a key arousal node in vertebrates, \nfunctions as a central hub in global CBF coordination through driving capillary -to-\narteriole patterned activities of brain -wide pericytes. Such patterned activities arise \nfrom LC-NE signaling to capillary and arteriole end pericytes, mediated preferentially \nby direct NE and indirect glia -relayed actions, respectively. This LC -NE neuron -\npericyte coupling causes brain -wide patterned vasoconstriction and thereby facilitates \nglobal CBF allocation, supporting sustained behavioral performance.

Various studies have \nshown that abnormal functional activity of the cerebellum is associated with autism spectrum \ndisorders. And Methyl-CPG-binding protein 2 ( MeCP2) gene plays an important role in the \nregulation of autism. The change of MeCP2 gene can affect the functional activity of PC, but the \nregulatory mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, MeCP2 cKO mice, a hybrid offspring of MeCP2 \ntransgenic mice and Pcp2-Cre mice, were used for experiments, in this study. In the three-chamber \ntest (TCT), the frequency of entered the social interaction behavior significantly less in MeCP2 cKO \nmice than the control group. And MeCP2 cKO mice showed a significant decrease in exploratory \nbehavior compared with control mice in open-field test. Furthermore, the patch clamp test showed \nlower spike firing frequency of PC in MeCP2 cKO mice than in the control group. No difference \nwas found in the spike firing frequency  of PC in the cKO mice with or without GABA receptor \nblockers SR95531 (10 microns). After the application of AMPA receptor blocker NBQX (500 nm), \nthe spike firing frequency of PC in MeCP2 cKO mice were not changed that before administration. \nThe results of after -hyperpolarization potential and inward rectifier potassium current showed \naccording to the results of MeCP2 cKO group mice PC after-hyperpolarizing potential (AHP) and \ninward rectifier potassium current (IR) significantly increased compared with control group.

Animal \nmodels of ASD exhibit an abundance of synapses in different brain regions, which is \nstrongly linked to the appearance of ASD behaviors. Overexpress ion of CD47 on \nneurons acts as a \"don’t eat me\" signal, safeguarding synapses from inappropriate \npruning by microglia. Indeed, CD47 overexpression occurs in 16p11.2 deletion carriers, \ncausing decreased synaptic phagocytosis and the manifestation of ASD characteristics. \nHowever, the role of CD47 in synaptic pruning impairment leading to ASD phenotypes \nin the 16p11.2 deletion mouse model is unclear. Moreover, whether blocking CD47 can \nalleviate ASD mice's behavioral deficits remains unknown.

Additionally, we reduced CD47 level in the  \nprefrontal cortex (PFC) of 16p11.2 deletion mice using  antibodies or knock -down \nAA Vs, and then quantified th e effects on microglia phagocytosis, excitatory \ntransmission and social behavior. Results We demonstrate a strong link between \nincreased CD47 expression, decreased microglia phagocytosis capacity, and increased \nimpairment in social novelty preference in the 16p11.2 deletion mice.

Methods A de novo single-nucleotide variant in CHD3 (c.C3073T, p.R1025W) was identified in a patient clinically diagnosed with SNIBCPS. A Chd3R1025W/+ mouse model was generated to examine the effect of this variant on behavior and CHD3 protein levels. A TadA-embedded adenine base editor (TeABE) was delivered to the mouse brain via adeno-associated virus (AA V). In addition, the efficiency of TeABE assembly and neuronal expression was assessed in nonhuman primates. Results (1) The R1025W variant in CHD3 resulted in accelerated degradation of CHD3 protein.

Immunofluorescence staining was employed to analyze the \ndistribution and migration of cortical interneuron subtypes. Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) \nwas performed to identify dysregulated genes associated with interneuron development, followed \nby RT-qPCR validation of candidate genes. Results - Alg13-deficient mice exhibited abnormal \nspatiotemporal distribution of cortical interneurons compared to WT mice. Specific subtypes of \ninterneurons showed disrupted laminar positioning within the cortex. The migration capacity of \nmultiple interneuron subtypes was significantly suppressed in Alg13- deficient mice, potentially \ncontributing to increased epileptogenicity.  Transcriptomic analysis identified three genes —Ndn, \nDynlt1b, and C3 —as critical factors linked to inhibitory interneuron development. RT -qPCR \nconfirmed consistent expression trends with RNA-seq data. Conclusion - Alg13 deficiency disrupts \nthe postnatal development of cortical interneurons, leading to abnormal subtype -specific \ndistribution, impaired migration, and altered expression of neurodevelopmental genes (Ndn, \nDynlt1b, C3). These structural and molecular disturbances likely underlie the heightened epilepsy \nsusceptibility and severity observed in Alg13 -deficient mice. Our findings highlight that ALG13 \ndually regulates interneuron architecture and molecular pathways, identifying therapeutic targets for \nALG13-associated refractory epilepsy. \n \nKeywords:  \nALG13 deficiency, cortical interneurons, neuronal migration, RNA sequencing", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051215443173.pdf"}, {"title": "Oxytocin modulates white matter functional connectivity tensor dynamics in depressive symptoms", "text": "Oxytocin modulates white matter functional connectivity \ntensor dynamics in depressive symptoms \nXiaodong Zhang1#, Chunmei Lan1#, Dezhong Yao1, Benjamin Becker2, Keith M.

Despite the fact that schizophrenic cerebral atrophy has been\ndescribed for almost half a century, the molecular identity of schizophrenic cerebral atrophy\nremains unknown. Using genetic strategies, we discovered that SWELL1 (LRRC8A), a core\nsubunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), is required for maintaining brain volume\nin schizophrenia. Aberrant expression of LRRC8A induces schizophrenia-related behaviors and\ncerebral atrophy. In mechanism, under initial isotonic conditions, VRAC responds to changes in\nosmolality due to neuronal secondary K+ flow and regulates neuronal K+ permeability, thereby\ncontrolling neuronal activity and volume. This mechanism is highly conserved in mouse neurons\nand human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)–derived neurons.

Emerging evidence implicates transcriptional dysregulation in the\netiology of multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, yet only a handful of Integrator subunits have\nbeen linked to brain development. Here, we investigate whether monoallelic INTS6 variants\nunderlie neurodevelopmental disorders and define INTS6’s role in cortical development and\nbehavior. Methods: We screened 23 NDD families by exome sequencing, used structural\nmodeling and functional assays to test variant effects on Integrator–PP2A assembly, and generated\na nervous-system conditional Ints6 knockout (cKO) mouse. Cortical lamination, progenitor\nproliferation, neuronal differentiation and synapse formation were assessed by immunostaining,\nspine imaging and EM. Behavioral impacts were measured via social interaction, water maze and\nopen-field tests. CUT&Tag and RNA-seq profiled RNA polymerase II binding and gene\nexpression. Results: Heterozygous truncating and de novo missense INTS6 variants co-segregated\nwith language/motor delays, autism, intellectual disability and sleep disturbance. Ints6 cKO mice\ndisplayed expanded VZ/SVZ, thinned cortical plate, fewer progenitors and neurons, reduced spine\ndensity and altered synaptic ultrastructure. Heterozygotes showed impaired social novelty, spatial\nmemory deficits and hyperactivity. Molecular assays revealed shifted Pol II occupancy at TSS,\nmisregulated synaptic and cell-cycle genes, and decreased Ser2 phosphorylation. Conclusion:\nINTS6 haploinsufficiency uncouples Integrator–PP2A–Pol II function, leading to cortical\nmalformation, synaptic deficits and behavioral abnormalities.

Established a depression model using chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). After the\nintervention, behavioral tests were used to assess behavioral changes.

The therapeutic\neffects of CWJ were comparable to FLX. (2) Transcriptomic sequencing showed that compared\nwith the CTRL group, there were 339 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the mPFC of\nCUMS rats. After intervention with CWJ, 123 of these DEGs were effectively reversed. The\nDEGs were mainly involved in pathways such as the TNF signaling pathway and the MAPK\nsignaling pathway. (3) Compared with the CTRL group, the expression levels of NF-κB and IKBα\nproteins in the CUMS group were upregulated, the number of IBA1-positive microglial cells in\nthe mPFC was significantly increased, and the postsynaptic density was significantly reduced.

In recent years, hundreds of risk \ngenes associated with autism have been identified, many of which are directly linked to epigenetic \nmechanisms. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is one of the high-risk genes for \nautism, whose mutations cause ADNP syndrome with an ASD -like phenotype (also known as \nHelsmoortel-VanDerAa syndrome, HVDAS). In our collection of the largest ADNP mutation cohort \nin China, we found that missense mutations close to the zinc finger lead s to abnormal ADNP \nlocalization and neuronal morphology. In addition, 3D protein structure prediction showed that the \nstructure of the zinc fingers of the mutant was altered . In the mouse model, the homozygous mice \nshowed developmental abnormalities in embryonic stage, with significant down-regulation of genes \nrelated to neurogenesis and synaptic development, which is largely consistent with previous studies \nreporting transcriptome changes and abnormal neurodevelopmental phenotypes in haploin-\nsufficiency mice. However, heterozygous mice exhibit completely different transcriptome changes. \nExtracting patient blood to culture induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we confirmed that this \nmutant has an altered genome-wide distribution by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vitro. Altered \nchromatin binding leads to abnormal GABAergic neuron development by mediating the formation \nof the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 bivalent domain of NKX2 -1, an important regulator of GABAergic \nneuron development, which may be associated with the development of ASD. In summary, we found \nfor the first time that ADNP missense mutation is pathogenic, and in the future, we will continue to \nexplore the upstream mechanism of pathogenicity of this missense mutation.

Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), a modulator of chromatin remodeling highly expressed in the brain, has been recognised as one of the most frequently mutated genes in ASD. The research on the mechanism of ADNP implication in the pathogenesis has hitherto focused on the embryonic stage, as developmental abnormalities are considered the core factor mediating the phenotypes. However, we discovered a punctate distribution of ADNP in the postnatal neurons, contrasting with its diffuse localization in embryos, indicating the possibility of a stage-specific regulation. The intention of this study is to decipher the mechanism and biological function underlying this peculiar localization pattern. Methods To investigate the postnatal function of ADNP, we constructed conditional knock-out mice by CRISPR-Cas9. Behavioral tests such as open-filed test, forced swimming test were utilized to identify the behavior abnormalities. Fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting is used for the separation of neuron nuclei. The alternation of ADNP binding on chromosomes at different stage is captured by CUT&Tag. Transcriptional and epigenetic state across the whole genome after ADNP knockout is detected by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Results (1) loss of ADNP leads to anxiety-depressive-like behavior and a significant decline in brain and body weight. (2) A group of genes that function on cation-binding and transport is upregulated at the transcriptional level, hinting a possible involvement of disturbance in the homeostasis of metal ions. (3) H3K9me3 signal is unregulated in the 50kb window though only a few peaks correlate with differentially-expressed genes. Conclusion In the postnatal neurons, ADNP participates in the maintenance of histone modification such as H3K9me3 and its loss remodels the transcriptome and epigenome, which may culminate in anxiety-depressive-like behavior.

Our research has revealed \nthat in the brains of ADNP knockout mice during development, there is a substantial increase in the \nH3K9me3 signals, in conjunction with the previously reported upregulation of CTCF b inding \nsignals and primarily localized to short interspersed nuclear elements ( SINE) B2.

Moreover, these upK9CTCF regions exhibit an open but repressed \nchromatin state in mice from embryonic 15.5 day to adolescence, but not ESC.

Microglial pyroptosis, a form of\nprogrammed cell death associated with inflammation, has been implicated in exacerbating\nneuroinflammation and secondary injury following TBI. Compound porcine cerebroside\nganglioside injection (CPCGI) has shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, but its\neffects on pyroptosis remain unexplored. This study investigates the role of CPCGI in TBI and its\nunderlying mechanisms. Methods A controlled cortical impact (CCI) model was utilized to\nestablish TBI in vivo, while lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used in vitro to induce microglial\nactivation that mimicked TBI conditions. The effects of CPCGI on microglial pyroptosis and\ninflammatory cytokines were analyzed through immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, western\nblotting, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The involvement of the NLRP3\ninflammasome in CPCGI's mechanism was examined using NLRP3 overexpression or the NLRP3\nagonist BMS-986299. A microglia–neuron interaction model was created, and neuronal injury\nwas assessed with the Cell Counting Kit-8 and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC). Results Treatment with\nCPCGI resulted in significant improvement in the neurobehavioral outcomes, reduced lesion\nvolume, and decreased neuronal loss following TBI. Notably, TBI induced microglial pyroptosis\nand the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while CPCGI inhibited microglial pyroptosis,\nthereby mitigating the inflammatory response and reducing neuronal damage. Mechanistically,\noverexpression of NLRP3 in microglial cells reversed the inhibitory effects of CPCGI on\nmicroglial pyroptosis, indicating that CPCGI's inhibition of microglial pyroptosis may be\nmediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, NLRP3 overexpression or administration of\nthe NLRP3 agonist BMS-986299 negated the neuroprotective effects of CPCGI in vivo and in\nvitro. Conclusion These findings suggest that CPCGI provides neuroprotection in TBI by\ntargeting NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated microglial pyroptosis, thereby improving the\nneuroinflammatory microenvironment and promoting neurological recovery. This underscores its\npotential as a promising candidate for TBI treatment.\nKey words: NLRP3 inflammasomes; compound porcine cerebroside ganglioside injection;\ngasdermin D; neuroinflammation; pyroptosis; traumatic brain injury.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061211222027.pdf"}, {"title": "Aging-associated decline of neuronal PD-L1 augments CD8+ T cell-mediated neuroinflammation", "text": "Aging-associated decline of neuronal PD-L1 augments CD8+ T cell-mediated\nneuroinflammation\nMengjiao Sun1,2, Nuo Cheng3, Kaibin Shi1,2, Wei-Na Jin1\n1.

The mechanism studies were performed in old and aged mice.Results: We\nidentified programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a restriction factor of lymphocyte accumulation in the\nbrain. PD-L1 is expressed specifically in neurons of the central nervous system and gradually declines with\naging, associating with increased accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the aged human and mouse brain.\nPharmacological blockade or genetic deficiency of PD-L1 in young mice increased accumulation of CD8+ T\ncells in the brain with enhanced IFN-γ and TNF-α generation, and impaired cognitive function,\nrecapitulating the features of aging. This was further confirmed in mice with conditional knockout of PD-L1\nin neurons. Ex vivo coculture of brain slices with CD8+ T cells showed that the brain tissue of young mice is\ncapable of limiting CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation, which was disabled in brain tissue of wild-type\naged mice or young PD-L1-/- mice.

However, the effect of calcium\noverloading-mediated calcineurin activation on UBE2O regulation and the role of UBE2O in calcium\noverloading-induced apoptosis remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of calcium\noverloading on UBE2O expression and underlying mechanisms, as well as its role in apoptosis. We\nfound that calcium overloading increases the expression of UBE2O mediated by upregulating UBE2O\npromoter activity while calcineurin inhibitor alleviates this effect. Moreover, three functional binding\nsites of MEF2A, a downstream target of calcineurin, are identified within the promoter region of the\nUBE2O gene.

A common finding\nin AD is the occurrence of DNA damage in neurons, with double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs)\nbeing particularly hazardous. Neurons, in their postmitotic state, rely on Non-homologous end\njoining (NHEJ) to repair DSBs. However, in AD, neuronal DNA damage is repaired by\nhomologous recombination (HR), a cell cycle-dependent repair pathway. This aberrant cell-cycle\nre-entry is lethal and can lead to senescence and death of neurons. Recent studies have highlighted\nthe neuroprotective effects of butyrate, which exhibits positive effects on various AD-related\nprocesses, including epigenetic regulation, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) metabolism.\nHowever, does butyrate restore the DNA damage repair pathway improve AD still unclear? In this\nstudy, we investigated the protective effects of butyrate on 5xFAD mice. Our results demonstrate\nthat butyrate intervention significantly improves spatial learning and memory in these mice,\nreduces Aβ pathology, and decreases the number of senescent-like neurons. Coincidentally, key\nHR proteins were significantly reduced, while NHEJ key proteins were increased in treated\nneurons. This study aims to explore the role of butyrate in alleviating AD pathology by partially\nrestoring the damage repair pathways of neurons. The findings provide a foundation for future\nresearch into butyrate-based therapies for AD.\nKeyword: Alzheimer’s disease; butyric acid; Double-strand DNA breaks; Non-homologous end\njoining (NHEJ ); homologous recombination(HR)", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060909221720.pdf"}, {"title": "Research on the Neuroprotective Effects of Closed-Loop STN-DBS Constructed Based on the Primary Motor Cortex in Parkinsonian Rats", "text": "Research on the Neuroprotective Effects of Closed-Loop STN-DBS Constructed Based on the Primary Motor Cortex in Parkinsonian Rats Wang xiaofeng1, Chen min1, Su fei1, Xin tao1 1Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, 250014, China E-mile: drwangxiaofeng@126.com Abstract: Objective This study aims to construct closed-loop STN-DBS based on the primary motor cortex of PD rats and validate its effectiveness through animal experiments, molecular biology experiments, behavioral experiments, etc. Additionally, the study seeks to explore the mechanism of action of DBS through molecular imaging techniques and mass spectrometry chromatography techniques. Methods 1. The hemi Parkinson's disease rat model was constructed by stereotactic injection of 6-OHDA. Subsequently, stimulating electrodes were implanted in the STN, and recording electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the M1. Through continuous four-week electrophysiological recordings, neura electrophysiological data were collected under different activity states, and the neural electrical activities under different activity states were analyzed and compared. A closed-loop STN-DBS regulation strategy based on M1 was constructed and applied to PD rats for continuous DBS regulation for 5 days. 2. Molecular imaging techniques were utilized to further explore the molecular mechanisms by which DBS improves motor function in PD rats. 3. High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry techniques were used to detect changes in neurochemical substances in the striatal region, analyzing and comparing metabolic changes in neurochemical substances before and after DBS. From the perspective of neurochemical substances, the potential mechanisms by which DBS improves PD rats were explained. Results We combined the power analysis of each frequency band in the lesioned-side M1-LFP signal with the random forest algorithm to develop a closed-loop DBS control model capable of real-time decoding of brain states. Behavioral experiments proved that both closed-loop DBS and open-loop DBS improved the motor function of PD rats from different perspectives. Additionally, analysis of dendritic spine density before and after stimulation by Golgi staining showed that DBS significantly increased the density of dendritic spines on the lesioned side to improve synaptic plasticity. Further analysis revealed that DBS significantly reduced the levels of glutamate and GABA in PD rats. Furthermore, we further confirmed that DBS reduced glutamate levels in the striatal region of PD rats and improved motor function by increasing histamine and histidine levels. Conclusions (1) Closed-loop STN-DBS based on the primary motor cortex can improve motor function and provide certain neuroprotective effects in PD rats. (2) DBS may exert its effects by reducing glutamate and GABA levels in the striatal region to inhibit the excitability of the basal ganglia and modulate neural output. (3) Long-term DBS reduces serotonin levels in the striatum, which may be a neurotransmitter-related factor in DBS-induced depression. Additionally, DBS can upregulate histamine and histidine levels in the striatum to improve motor function.

Overexpression of NEDD4L leads \nto degeneration and cell death of medium spiny  neurons (MSNs), along with a reduction in motor \nactivities. Conversely, deletion of NEDD4L restores abnormal MSN morphology, corrects deficits \nin calcium signaling, alleviates neurodegeneration in HD -hSOs, and improves motor dysfunction \nobserved in YAC128 mice.

Despite extensive research, the \nunderlying pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. The growth hormone secretagogue \nreceptor (GHSR), a member of the G protein -coupled receptor family, is highly \nexpressed in the substantia nigra. Our previous studies have demonstrated that GHSR \ncan be activated by ghreli n, leading to neuroprotective effects. Notably, GHSR also \nexhibits constitutive activity, capable of transmitting intracellular signals even in the \nabsence of ghrelin. Importantly, the likelihood of circulating ghrelin crossing the blood-\nbrain barrier is quite low, which implies that ghrelin is unable to effectively target the \nmajority of GHSR in the brain. Given this context, the role of highly GHSR expression \nin the substantia nigra in relation to PD warrants investigation. \nIn this study, we first used the neurotoxin MPTP to induce a PD model in GHSR \nknockout (Ghsr-/-) mice to elucidate the significance of GHSR in dopaminergic neurons. \nOur findings revealed that the absence of GHSR accelerated the degeneration of \ndopaminergic neurons in the PD mouse model. Additionally, we observed a significant \nreduction in both the e xpression and activity of GHSR in the PD model. We further \nidentified that GHSR knockout led to autophagy dysfunction, potentially mediated by \nDEPTOR, contributing to the enhanced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. \nFurthermore, we used D-SP to inhibit the constitutive activity of GHSR. We also found \nthat the damage of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra was exacerbated, which \nmay be related to apoptosis mediated by mito phagy dysfunction. Reducing the \nconstitutive activity of GHSR could activate the PI3K/Akt pathway and down-regulate \nthe expression of FOXO1, inhibiting PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and PGC-1α-\nmediated mitochondrial regeneration, which ultimately lead to the accumulation of \ndysfunctional mitochondria in cells and an increase in cellular oxygen free radicals. \nUltimately, it induces the occurrence of apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons.  \nThis study enhances our understanding of GHSR’s role in PD -related \nneurodegeneration and provides a new theoretical foundation for potential therapeutic \napproaches in treating PD. \nKey words: Parkinson’s disease; GHSR; Autophagy; KLF4; DEPTOR; Mitophagy", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051216335888.pdf"}, {"title": "Cortical Morphometric Inverse Divergence in vascular cognitive impairment correlates with specific transcriptional patterns and neurobiological features", "text": "Cortical Morphometric Inverse Divergence in vascular cognitive \nimpairment correlates with specific transcriptional patterns and \nneurobiological features \n \nLin-Na JI1, Si-Si PENG1, Hao SONG1, Ran ZHANG1, Dong-Wei LV1, Hao-Ying HE1, Fan FAN1, \nDong SUN1, Juan XU1, Jun-Jian ZHANG1,*  \n \n1Department of Neurology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China \n \n*Corresponding author \n \nE-mail: zhangjj@whu.edu.cn \n \nAbstract: Objective  The pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is complicated, \ninvolving brain atrophy,  parenchymal damage and functional dysconnectivity associated with \nvascular risk factors, cerebrovascular diseases and mixed pathologies.

Finally, we investigated the regulatory role of Trx-\n1 on the main signaling pathways involved in Golgi stress. Results We demonstrated that MPTP led \nto the loss of DA neurons in the SNpc and motor impairment in mice, while overexpression of Trx-\n1 restored MPTP -induced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and improved motor behavior deficits. \nAdditionally, overexpression of Trx-1 mitigated MPTP-induced GA fragmentation and expression \nof GM130 and reduce α-syn aggregation in GA.

Despite\nincreasing recognition of this connection, the precise pathogenesis of IBD-associated mental disorders\nremains unclear, and current treatment options are limited and often ineffective. Recent studies have\nhighlighted that drug delivery targeting the intestine can not only alleviate the intestinal inflammation\ncharacteristic of IBD but also improve anxiety and depressive behaviors by modulating the gut-brain\naxis. Therefore, the development of oral nanomedicines that both suppress intestinal inflammation and\nregulate gut-brain communication is of critical importance for the comprehensive treatment of IBD\nand its related anxiety and depression-like symptoms. Here, we report an oral polyphenol armored\nnanomaterial of probiotics (EcN) encapsulated layer by layer with chitosan nanoparticles (CS) and\ntannic acid (TA), which has a multilayer structure of chitosan and tannic acid (CS/TA) and is called\n\"armor\". Methods The CS/TA multilayer film can protect the EcN from the harsh environment of the\ngastrointestinal tract and adhere to the inflamed colon in a targeted manner. TA provides antioxidant\nstress and prebiotic activity, regulating different gut microbiota. CS has anti-inflammatory effects and\nenhances the adhesion performance of EcN. Furthermore, the restoration of intestinal healthy\nhomeostasis regulates brain activity through the gut-brain axis. Results CS/TA exhibited strong\nresistance to the harsh gastrointestinal environment and effectively facilitated the targeted adhesion of\nEcN to inflamed intestinal regions.

One \nof the key molecular drivers of this process is the second messenger cGAMP , produced by cGAS in \nresponse to leaked mitochondrial DNA that activates the STING pathway. Despite its critical role, \nthe spatiotemporal dynamics of cGAMP remain poorly understood, largely due to limitations in \ndetection methods. To address this gap, we leveraged the intramolecular conformational changes \nthat occur when cGAMP binds to STING, engineering a suite of genetically encoded intensiometric \ncGAMP sensors. In vitro characterization revealed that these sensors exhibit remarkable sensitivity, \nwith >2000% ΔF/F0 response to cGAMP and EC\n50 values ranging from 10 to 500 nM.

Substantial evidence has established that the brain’s innate immune system—particularly microglia and other glial populations—plays a central role in orchestrating these pathological processes. However, effective strategies to therapeutically reprogram brain-resident immune responses remain limited. Methods We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of HS-03, a therapeutic agent derived from biochemically modified placental gp96 (a heat shock protein with innate immune-stimulating activity), in two AD mouse models: 5xFAD (Aβ-driven) and P301S (tauopathy). Results (1) In 6-month-old 5xFAD mice, HS-03 treatment significantly improved cognitive performance and reduced Aβ plaque burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing of brain immune and glial cells revealed altered cellular composition, enhanced intercellular communication, and functional reprogramming of microglia. (2) In the P301S tauopathy model, HS-03 alleviated tau pathology and behavioral deficits, supporting its therapeutic potential in tau-driven neurodegeneration. (3) In vitro co-culture assays confirmed HS-03-induced immune remodeling and intercellular interaction changes, consistent with in vivo data. Conclusion These findings support exogenous HS-03 as a potential immunomodulatory strategy for AD, with ongoing efforts to elucidate mechanisms in tauopathy.

Chinese herbal medicine has been shown to modulate the activation of inflammasomes and the inflammatory response via multiple mechanisms. Mogroside V (MV) exhibits potential anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of MV on PD and its underlying mechanisms. Methods In vivo, PD animal models were established by striatal stereotactic injection of rotenone (Rot) or α-synuclein (α-Syn) preformed fibrils. MV was administrated by gavage to intervene PD mice. Open-field test, rotarod test, and gait analysis were conducted to evaluate the movement abilities of mice. Subsequently, dopaminergic neuron damage and α-Syn pathologic changes were analyzed through immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analyses. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of MV were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and biochemical analysis. Besides, inflammatory factors, like TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vitro, MV was applied to treat with Rot-induced or α-Syn overexpressed cells. Then, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Thereafter, network pharmacology, and RNA transcriptome analysis were employed to identify potential targets and signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effect of MV on PD, which were further validated by biochemical methods. Furthermore, the binding stability of MV and its target proteins was investigated with cellular thermal shift assay. Results (1) Continuous MV intervention was found to effectively improve the motor impairment and dopaminergic neuron damage of PD mice.

The main pathological manifestations of PD are the selective loss of dopaminergic\nneurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the presence of Lewy bodies mainly composed of\nalpha-synuclein in the remnant neurons, and abnormal iron deposition in the substantia nigra\nregion. Previous studies have reported that overexpression of α-synuclein can induce cellular\nsenescence in the substantia nigra region of C57BL/6 mice. This process occurs earlier than the\nloss of dopaminergic neurons and motor dysfunction, suggesting that cellular senescence may be\nan early pathological mechanism of PD. Neuroinflammation caused by microglial activation plays\na non-negligible role in the pathological progression of PD. After eliminating microglia, the\nsymptoms related to cell senescence induced by α-synuclein in the substantia nigra region of\nC57BL/6 mice can be significantly improved.

One particular hormone secreted by both of the brain and the gut, \ncholecystokinin, can be processed to form subtype C8S which executes biological functions. It has \nattracted increasing attention due to its widespread distribution and potential involvement in brain-\nbody communication. While dysregulation of this peptide has been observed in several neurological \nconditions, its physiological and pathological roles remain largely unclear. In this study, we utilized \na mouse model with chronically elevated peripheral levels of this peptide to explore its systemic \nimpact in vivo. Behavioral and histological analyses revealed alterations indicative of \nneuroinflammatory responses and functional impairments. These findings suggest that abnormal \nperipheral levels of this peptide may influence brain health during critical periods, offering new \nperspectives on its potential contribution to neurological disease.   \nObjective: The global prevalence of mental health disorders continues to rise at an alarming rate, \nyet their underlying pathological mechanisms remain largely elusive.

While \nthe changes of H3K4me in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are not fully elucidated. Here, we established \nthe PD model  in cells and mice to clarify the changes of H3K4me in  PD. Methods 6-\nHydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was used to establish the PD models in vitro and in vivo. The CCK8 \nassays and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays were used for measuring the cell viability. \nThe open field  test, gait analysis  and rotarod test were applied to screened out  the mice with \nsignificant motor dysfunction. The western blot (WB) and frozen sections immunofluorescence co-\nlocalization staining (IF-F) were used to detect the expression of H3K4me2/3, and the co-expression \nof H3K4me2/3 with TH, IBA1, GFAP, respectively. Results Our results showed that 6-OHDA could \ninduce PC12 cell damage, and lead to motor dysfunction in mice by increasing dopaminergic neuron \ndeath in the substantia nigra (SN). The level of H3K4me2/3 was significantly increased in 6-OHDA-\ninduced PC12 cells and SN region of PD mice.

Studies have shown that the pathological mechanism \nof PD involves multiple factors, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress -induced damage, \nmitochondrial dysfunction, and brain iron deposition . The present study is to elucidate the \npathogenesis of PD through transcriptomic analysis at the cellular level. Methods The PD cellular \nmodel was established by treating PC12 cells with 6 -hydroxydopamine (6- OHDA), and RNA-\nsequencing technology was employed for subsequent analysis.  After quality control and filtering, \ndifferential gene expression and associated pathways were analyzed to identify potential target \ngenes related to PD. Results (1) After 24 hours of 6-OHDA treatment, cell viability of PC12 cells \nshowed no significant change at 20 μ mol/L but decreased in a concentration -dependent manner at \n40 μmol/L, 80 μmol/L, and 100 μmol/L (P < 0.01). Based on the changes  of cell viability induced \nby 6-OHDA, 40 μmol/L 6-OHDA was selected as the optimal concentration for 24 -hour treatment \nto establish the PD cellular model. (2) Transcriptomic analysis of the 6-OHDA-treated and control \ngroups identified a total of 455 differentially expressed genes, of which 304 were upregulated and \n151 were downregulated.

While extracellular matrix interactions are critical for neural repair, neuronal responsiveness to these cues remains poorly understood. Previous studies have indicated that, DDR2, a collagen-activated receptor tyrosine kinase are highly expressed in resilient RGC subtypes, suggesting its potential involvement in neuroprotective and regenerative processes. This study investigates DDR2's role in promoting RGC survival and axon regeneration after injury.  Methods Retinal ganglion cell-specific expression of Ddr2 was achieved using the mSNCG promoter in AAV2 vectors by intravitreal administration. Neuronal regeneration and survival were assessed using optic nerve crush (ONC) model. Functional recovery was evaluated in an NMDA-induced excitotoxicity model through visual cliff and optomotor response tests. The molecular mechanism was investigated by comparing full-length Ddr2 with a collagen binding-defective variant in primary cortical neurons, confirming ECM interaction requirement for Ddr2-mediated neuroprotection. Results (1) Ddr2 overexpression significantly enhanced axonal regeneration and RGC survival at both 2-week and 4-week post-crush timepoints, with notably greater protection observed in vulnerable RGC subtypes. (2) Following NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, Ddr2-OE mice exhibited significant functional recovery, as measured by improvements in both optomotor response and visual depth perception tests. (3) Experiments in primary neuronal cultures confirmed that the neuroprotective effect of Ddr2 required intact collagen-binding capacity. Conclusion DDR2 signaling promotes retinal ganglion cell survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve injury in mice, a capacity critically dependent on its direct interaction with collagen.

However, its role and\nmechanism in AD pathology remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CALCRL, a core\ncomponent of the CGRP receptor, is upregulated in the hippocampal lysate of AD dementia\npatients and 5×FAD mice. Knockout of the CGRP receptor ligand Calca or pharmacological\nblockade using Rimegepant (Rim), reduces soluble Aβ1-42 oligomer-induced neuronal death and\nglial inflammation. Rim treatment also rescues neurobehavioral impairments, neurodegeneration,\nand lipid metabolism dysfunction in 5×FAD mice. Mechanistically, these effects are mediated\nthrough HDAC11 inhibition, which enhances LXRβ acetylation and ABCA1 expression,\npromoting the reprogramming of neuronal lipid metabolism.

Visceral motor reflexes and spinal local field potentials were \nrecorded to evaluate EA-induced analgesia. Results CHRNA3⁺ MINs, identified as C-type nociceptors co-expressing \nTrkA, pERK, and PIEZO2, were found to innervate both the colon and the lumbar skin (BL25 region) via axonal \nbifurcation.

Results (1) On the behavioral aspects, spontaneous recovery of\nhand-motor skills was notably limited in both human patients and monkey models, indicated by\nconsistently abnormal “thumb-in-palm” patterns in the finger-kinetic analysis. (2) However, the\nCC7 surgery gradually restored finger kinetic patterns in hand-pinch actions to nearly identical\npatterns of the healthy-hand. (3) On the neural basis aspects, both human fMRI and macaque\nelectrophysiology results supported emergences of a new commanding area and its spiking-based\nmotor-command refinements specifically for the paralyzed hand in the contra-lesional M1 and\npremotor cortex (PMC) after the CC7 treatment. Conclusion Our findings have strongly endorsed\nthe notion that the CC7 surgery greatly promotes recovery of dexterous motor functions of the\nparalyzed hand, through reconstructing new motor-control neural mechanisms within the\nipsi-lateral healthy motor cortex.\nKeywords: Motor learning; Dexterous Control; Non-human disease model; Hemiplegia; Single\nNeuron Electrophysiology", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061810115354.pdf"}, {"title": "Gβ2 modulates norepinephrine dependent impulsivity in mice", "text": "Gβ2 modulates norepinephrine dependent impulsivity in mice \nYu-Ting JIANG, Chang-yao LIU, Xiao-Xiao HE* \n \nKey Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics, Ministry of Education and Institute of Cytology and \nGenetics, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China. \n \nE-mail: hexx100@nenu.edu.cn. \n \nAbstract: Objective Impulsive behavior is one of the typical phenotypes of attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

However, \nthe spatiotemporal characteristics of NE release  in vivo  are still poorly understood due to the \nlimitations of NE detection methods. To approach this question, we used GPCR-activation-based \nfluorescent NE sensors  GRABNE2m to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of endogenous NE \nrelease in the intact brain of larval zebrafish in which a single LC-NE neuron is sparsely labeled and \nGRABNE2m is evenly expressed in neuropil . Combining in vivo confocal imaging and whole-cell \nrecording of LC-NE neurons’ electrical activities, we found that phasic firing -induced NE release \nfrom individual varicosities exhibits activity frequency dependence: during low -frequency phasic \nfiring, NE release is positively correlated with firing frequency; during high-frequency phasic firing, \nNE release shows constrained characteristics. Different varicosities exhibit heterogeneity in the \nrelease properties, independent of their morphological sizes. Considering the alternation between \ntonic and phasic firing in the spontaneous activities of LC-NE neurons, we further discovered that \npreceding tonic firing enhances phasic firing-induced NE release in a frequency-dependent manner. \nAdditionally, consecutive phasic firing -induced NE release exhibits experience -dependent short-\nterm plasticity. At the population level of LC -NE neurons, phasic firing induces synchronous NE \nrelease across varicosities, and varicosities exerting similar release strength tend to be clustered to \nform relatively stable local release hotspots.  Thus, our work characterizes detailed spatiotemporal \nproperties of NE release in vivo  and may shed light on understanding how the LC -NE system \nmodulates neural circuits via volume transmission of NE at single varicosities under both \nphysiological and pathological conditions. \n \nKeywords: LC-NE system, GRAB NE2m, N orepinephrine release, Spatiotemporal characteristics, \nVolume transmission", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051421035413.pdf"}, {"title": "Argon-Protein Interactions: Characterization by molecular dynamics simulations and cryo-electron microscopy", "text": "Argon-protein interactions: characterization by molecular \ndynamics simulations and cryo-electron microscopy \nJie Cheng1,4, Yang-wei Jiang3,4, Bin Peng1, Mei-ning Tong1, Yuan Yuan1, Gong-ze Chen1, Shen-\nnuo Cheng1, Xiao-wen Ji1, Ru-hong Zhou3,*, Xing Zhang2,*, Zheng-Lin Jiang1,*, Xia Li1,* \n \n1 Institute of Special Environmental Medicine, Nantong University, Nantong, China. \n2 CCEM Center, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. \n3 MOE Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis & Protection, Institute of Biophysics, College \nof Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. \n4 First author \n*Corresponding author \nE-mail: lixia7979@ntu.edu.cn \n \nAbstract: Objective Inert gases exhibit anesthetic effects under hyperbaric conditions, \ncharacterized by abnormalities in motor and cognitive functions. These effects may result from \ndirect interactions with ion channel receptors, demonstrating a multi-target profile. The differences \nin anesthetic targets among various inert gases are potentially related to their physicochemical \nproperties, such as solubility, molecular size, and polarizability. Argon, the most abundant inert gas \nin the atmosphere, is inexpensi ve, easily accessible, and shows promising anesthetic and \nneuroprotective potential. However, limited studies suggest that argon may exert its anesthetic \neffects via GABA A receptors, though the evidence remains inconclusive. This study aims to \ninvestigate whether argon can directly modulate GABAA receptors to produce anesthetic effects and \nto identify potential molecular targets involved. Methods Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were \nconducted on HEK-293T cells transfected with human α1β2 GABAA receptor subunits to evaluate \nthe effects of 79% argon under normobaric conditions on the response to the application of GABA. \nIn vivo, open field tests  (OFT) were used to assess spontaneous locomotor activity in mice under \nvarying pressure conditions (0-2 MPa). Simultaneously, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings \nwere performed to monitor cortical activity. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to \nidentify potential argon-binding sites within the extracellular domain (ECD) of the GABAA receptor. \nResults Under normobaric conditions, 79% argon inhibited GABA response without significantly \naffecting spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. In contrast, high-pressure argon exposure elicited \na biphasic behavioral response : enhanced locomotion at 1.4 -1.6 MPa foll owed by marked \nsuppression at 2 MPa.

Despite their implications in various biological processes, the in vivo\ndynamics of AEA and 2-AG remain poorly understood due part to the lack of detection methods with\nadequate spatiotemporal resolution. Previously, our group developed an endocannabinoid sensor,\nGRABeCB2.0 (eCB2.0), enabling the monitoring of eCB dynamics in living animals. However, eCB2.0 is\nunable to distinguish signals contributed by AEA or 2-AG. To overcome this limitation, we performed\nstructure-guided sensor engineering of eCB2.0, resulting in the development of new AEA and 2-AG\nselective genetically encoded eCB sensors, GRABAEA2.0 (AEA2.0) and GRAB2-AG2.0 (2-AG2.0), with a\npeak ΔF/F0 exceeding 1000% and around 600% ΔF/F0 to AEA2.0 and 2-AG2.0, respectively. To tease\napart the contributions of AEA and 2-AG in response to aversive stimuli, we conducted fiber\nphotometry to record in vivo dynamics of AEA and 2-AG during foot shock in both the NAc core and\nBLA of mice. We found that only 2-AG2.0 exhibited specific time-locked signals during these behaviors,\nwhile decay time of signals in NAc core is much slower than that of BLA. Moreover, given the\nsignificant role of eCBs in psychoactive drug addiction, we extended our investigation to record AEA\nand 2-AG signals in the NAc shell during the administration of nicotine and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol\n(Δ9-THC). Interestingly, AEA signals were exclusively detected during nicotine intake, while only\n2-AG signals were observed during Δ9-THC administration. These findings highlight the distinct\nengagement of endocannabinoid signaling pathways in response to different addictive substances. In\nsummary, our newly engineered selective endocannabinoid sensors, GRABAEA2.0 and GRAB2-AG2.0,serve\nas robust tools for real-time monitoring of AEA and 2-AG dynamics in living animals.

There are billions of neurons in the human brain, and communication between neurons is mainly carried out through various neurotransmitters. Previously, our lab has successfully developed green and red fluorescent sensors for neurotransmitters based on the GPCR Activation Based (GRAB) strategy, which can sensitively and specifically detect dynamic changes in neurotransmitter levels with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, such intensity-based sensors are difficult to achieve quantitative detection of neurotransmitter levels due to intensity-related artifacts. The fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore is a characteristic parameter independent of fluorescence intensity and can be quantified, thus eliminating many intensity-related artifacts. Fluorescence lifetime thus provides a potential dimension to the development of quantitative fluorescent sensors while maintaining high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we have developed new chemigenetic lifetime-based GRAB sensors based on circularly permutated WHaloTag (HaloTag with a certain amino acid being mutated to tryptophan) for detecting various kinds of neurotransmitters, named GRAB-WHalo sensors. The optimized norepinephrine sensor GRAB-WHalo-NE-0.4 has achieved high response and high affinity to norepinephrine when labeled with red fluorescent dye JF552-HTL and far-red fluorescent dye JF669-HTL.

Prior studies focused on decoding spike signals (prone to\ntime-dependent degradation) while under-exploring stable local field potential (LFP) signals for\nSCI lower limb movement decoding. This study evaluated LFP-based decoding of rat hindlimb\nmovement states pre-/post-SCI, analyzed neural patterns, and compared algorithms to guide\nrehabilitation.

Neural signals (1kHz LFP, 40kHz raw) and left\nhindlimb kinematics were collected. LFP power in five bands was analyzed with feature\nprocessing, and SVM/FCNN/LDA models were tested against chance-level decoding. Results\nPre-SCI, low-frequency (1-4Hz, 3-10Hz) LFP power increased around foot-off events with\nstronger modulation depth. For decoding foot-off events, SVM (F1=0.618±0.050), FCNN\n(0.470±0.056), and LDA (0.450±0.071) all exceeded chance level.

Methods We utilized hyper-flexible\nelectrode array to simultaneously record neural activity from the primary motor cortex (M1),\nventral gigantocellular reticular nucleus (vGi), and lumbar spinal cord (L2) in awake mice\nperforming locomotion tasks. The stability and reliability of our SCI model were validated using\ngait analysis, while retrograde tracing was applied to map residual and newly formed projections\nbetween M1, vGi, and L2. We performed spike sorting and functional connectivity analysis to\ndecode network dynamics before and after injury.

While prior studies have identified temporal areas \ninvolved in this process, how these cortical areas dynamically coordinate these distributed inputs – \nparticularly i n ecologically valid contexts like face -to-face communication – remains poorly \nunderstood. Methods We recorded high -density electrocorticography (ECoG) signals when \nparticipants undergoing awake neurosurgery perceiving audiovisual, audio-only and video -only \nstimuli. Neural activity in temporal cortices was analyzed recorded and analyzed. Results Firstly, \nlip-reading kinematics were encoded in low -frequency bands (theta/beta1), while inner -mouth \narticulatory features (incisor/tongue) preferentially engaged high gamma in both audiovisual and \naudio-only conditions. Secondly, MTG exhibited earlier ERP responses (50–150 ms) to audiovisual \nstimuli compared to audio-only, with earlier high gamma encoding than audio-only ones. Thirdly, \nMTG uniquely encoded holistic facial expressions, absent in STG, which selectively processed lip \nmovements without integrating face or inner -mouth features. Conclusion The MTG orchestrates \ncross-frequency audiovisual integration through two mechanisms: accelerated temporal processing \n(low-to-high frequency cascades) for lip-speech alignment and additive high gamma encoding for \ninner-mouth kinematics.

The Affiliated Brain Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510370, China * Corresponding author E-mail:hannalu@cuhk.edu.hk Abstract: Background The hippocampus plays a representative role in maintaining the core cognitive function during healthy aging. However, current evidence of age-related hippocampal changes may be mixed by several factors, such as age, sex, status of the apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE 4) and subregional features. Thus, examining the effects of age and APOE 4 and their interaction effects on the hippocampal subregions in a healthy aged population can greatly enhance our understanding of hippocampus and benefit the therapeutic plans of cognitive decline or Alzheimer’s disease. Methods Two hundred old adults (age range: 62-89 years) with or without APOE 4 were recruited from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Based on T1-weighted structural MRI data, we quantified the volumes of hippocampal subregions using Freesurfer (version 7.4.1) and examined the effect of age and APOE 4 status on the hippocampus subregion volumes and global cognition measured by Mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Results Based on the Freesurfer 6.0 template, 11 subregions of hippocampus per hemisphere were extracted individually. Significant age effects were found on most subregions of hippocampus, except for bilateral parasubiculum and right Cornu Ammonis (CA) 4. With comparable MMSE score, APOE 4 carriers had significantly reduced volumes in bilateral CA1 (left: t = 2.445, p = 0.015; right: t = 2.129, p = 0.034) than non-carriers. The interaction effect of age and APOE 4 status is marginally significant on right presubiculum volume (p = 0.065). Conclusion Age and APOE 4 are both correlated with hippocampal volume loss, especially on subregions in hippocampal head. The atrophy related with APOE 4 on CA1 seems to appear early before the cognitive functions started to be affected.

A central function in mental programming is working memory (WM), involving both temporarily maintaining the information and manipulating it based on rules. While the neural mechanisms of WM maintenance have been extensively studied, those governing WM manipulation remain largely unknown. To bridge this gap, the present study focuses on an elementary operation in WM manipulation: re-ordering items in WM sequences. We propose a functional, biologically plausible neural circuit model that consists of two interconnected modules: a memory module composed of continuous attractor-based memory slots that store item features, and a control module sending gain-modulated commands to orchestrate specific operations in the memory module. The model successfully implements two-item swapping in a WM sequence, generating neuronal responses similar to recent primate experiments of WM sequence manipulation. By incorporating principles from the algebraic permutation group, we generalize the circuit model to accommodate more complex sequence manipulations. This math foundation reveals how arbitrary permutations can be decomposed into sequences of elementary swapping operations, which can be generated by a hierarchical tree-structured control circuit module. And the mutual inhibition within the control tree ensures that only one program is being executed at the same time. Our study establishes overarching connections among mental programming neural circuit models, neuroscience experiments, and abstract algebraic structure. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural underpinnings of cognitive reasoning and inspire the design of neural networks capable of executing sophisticated computational processes.

In addition, we explore the models’ interpretability in learning biologically features related\nto fetal brain development. Methods We used MRI scans from the Developing Human\nConnectome Project (dHCP), projected into 2D spherical representations. All models were trained\non NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

A multimodal alignment strategy was applied by incorporating\nvisual and numerical instructions during both training and testing. The CNN baseline used a\nResNet-18 architecture trained for 150 epochs on the same dataset.

Results CNN achieved a MAE of 11.30 (95% CI: [7.94, 17.40]) on the test set; the\nMLLM model achieved an MAE of 2.24 (95% CI: [1.192, 3.288]).

However, it remains unclear whether ASD rodent models \nexhibit significant variability in USV patterns, and the underlying neural mechanisms driving such \ndifferences are yet to be elucidated. Methods We recorded USVs in pups from two distinct ASD \nmodels: Shank3 knockout and prenatal valproic acid (VPA)-exposed offspring, during maternal \nseparation. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors, we conducted whole-\ncell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices to assess the excitability of neurons in the midbrain \nperiaqueductal gray (PAG), a key region implicated in USVs production. Furthermore, we measured \nhyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN2) channel currents, which are critical \nregulators of neuronal excitability in this region. Using a combination of pharmacological \ninterventions and USVs recordings, we analyzed the functional role of HCN2 channel modulation \nin shaping USV patterns in these ASD models.

Once formed, negative emotional memories, \nsuch as fear memories, are difficult to extinguish. When fear becomes overwhelming and extinction \nmechanisms are impaired, conditions like post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety \ndisorders emerge. Exposure therapy, rooted in fear extinction, remains the most effective \nintervention for PTSD, yet patients often report unmet social and emotional needs during treatment. \nMethods and Results (1) We developed an \"extinction together\" rodent model to simulate group \nexposure therapy for PTSD incorporating social components. Unexpectedly, extinction together did \nnot enhance fear extinction but instead led to social impairments. (2) Using the targeted \nrecombination in active populations  technique combined with c -fos staining, we identified the \nparaventricular nucleus (PVN) as a key brain region associated with these social deficits.          \n(3) Optogenetic inhibition of PVN oxytocin (OXT) neurons facilitated fear extinction and rescued \nsocial deficits, whereas activation of these neurons produced diametrically opposite effects.        \n(4) Through the translationally promising approach of intranasal OXT administration, we found that \nit not only facilitated fear extinction learning but also rescued the associated social impairments in \nthe extinction together paradigm. Conclusion Overactivation of the PVN OXT system impairs the \nefficacy of extinction together and induces social deficits, whereas intranasal OXT administration \nrescues both behavioral impairments.  These findings illuminate the complex interplay between \nsocial behavior and fear exti nction, offering new perspectives on improving PTSD treatments by \naddressing the social limitations of current therapeutic approaches. \n \nKeywords: PTSD; extinction together; social impairments; oxytocin; paraventricular nucleus", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051510461056.pdf"}, {"title": "Meningeal lymphatics link chronic stress to dCLN activation and brain IgG-driven neuroinflammation", "text": "Meningeal lymphatics link chronic stress to dCLN activation and brain \nIgG-driven neuroinflammation \nXaunming Guo1, Scott Russo1, * \n1Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York 10029, USA \n*Corresponding author \nE-mail: scott.russo@mssm.edu \nAbstract: Chronic psychosocial stress profoundly impacts brain function and peripheral immunity, yet \nthe mechanisms linking these systems remain elusive. This study investigates how chronic social defeat \nstress (CSDS) orchestrates brain-body interactions via the meningeal lymphatic system, driving \nneuroinflammation and potentially contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders. We focused on the \ninterplay between stress-induced alterations in meningeal lymphatic drainage to deep cervical lymph \nnodes (dCLNs), subsequent peripheral immune activation, and the feedback loop involving brain-reactive \nIgG. Using lymphatic tracer assays in mice, we discovered that CSDS significantly enhances antigen \ndrainage from the meninges to dCLNs, indicating altered lymphatic function as a key brain-to-body \ncommunication pathway under stress. This enhanced drainage correlated with heightened B cell \nactivation within dCLNs, signifying a peripheral immune response initiated by CNS-derived signals. \nExamining the brain side of this interaction, we observed robust immune activation within the meninges \nof stress-susceptible mice, including increased activated CD4+ T cells (CD44+CD62L-, CD69+) and \nenhanced antigen presentation capacity by MHCII-expressing macrophages. Critically, this meningeal \ninflammation was associated with increased accumulation of IgG within the brain parenchyma, \nspecifically localized between endothelial cells (CD31) and astrocyte end-feet (AQP4), suggesting IgG \ncrosses the blood-brain barrier. Functional validation using FcRn knockout mice, deficient in IgG \nrecycling, revealed attenuated neuroinflammatory responses and reduced anxiety-like behaviors following \nCSDS, confirming a pathogenic role for this body-to-brain IgG feedback. Our findings delineate a novel \nbrain-body interaction pathway where chronic stress alters meningeal lymphatic function, triggering \nperipheral immune activation (dCLN) which, in turn, promotes brain IgG accumulation and meningeal \ninflammation, creating a vicious cycle.

Model organisms, particularly Drosophila, play a pivotal role in elucidating the mechanisms underlying NSC development behaviors, such as asymmetric division, temporal regulation, termination, and the reactivation of quiescent NSCs. Methods Drosophila NSCs, termed neuroblasts (NBs), were employed. We utlized genetic screening, cell biology, biochemistry, genetic mutant flies, DamID-sequence, and TurboID-MS to identify novel regulators of NSC development. Results Here, we identified two pipsqueak family genes, distal antenna (dan) and distal antenna-related (danr), which promote the proliferation of NSC in third-instar larval brains. In the absence of Dan and Danr (Dan/Danr), NSCs produce fewer daughter cells and exhibit smaller lineage sizes. Larval brain NSCs in dan/danr clones show premature accumulation of nuclear Prospero (Pros), a marker typically observed in terminating NSCs at early pupal stage. This premature nuclear Pros leads to NSCs cell cycle defects and loss of NSC identities. Removal of Pros from dan/danr MARCM clones prevents lineage size shrinkage and rescues the loss of NSC markers. Additionally, our data indicated that Dan/Danr contains a protein interact domain and is a nucleoplasmic protein. Loss or overexpression of Dan/Danr disrupts the polarity phase in NSCs. Conclusion We propose that Dan/Danr antagonize nuclear Pros to prevent NSCs aging and contribute to transient polarity phase by interacting with other regulators of asymmetric cell division in Drosophila larval brains. This study reveals a novel genetic/proteomic regulatory network and provide new insights into the functions of Dan/Danr in NSC development.

SETDB1 is the histone H3 lysine 9\nmethyltransferase, which involved in the histone modification and 3D genome remodeling. In this\nstudy, mouse Setdb1 was specifically knocked out in neural precursor cells (NPCs), resulting in a\nsignificant increase of compartment counts in the 3D genome. Particularly, the ChIP-seq of\nH3K9me3 and hp1-alpha showed the H3K9me3 and hp1-alpha’ s up peaks were enriched in\nheterochromatin (B compartment). It is suggested that this phenomenon may be related to the\nphase separation mechanism. Provide new insights into the role of Setdb1 in the process of neural\ndevelopment. Methods Cre recombinase is expressed in mice with the genetic background of\nSetdb1flox/+ Nestin-cre+ males which are crossed to Setdb1flox/flox females to obtain Setdb1flox/flox\nNestin-cre+ mice. Setdb1flox/flox Nestin-cre+ mice are the knockout (i.e. KO) mice; Setdb1flox/+\nNestin-cre- and Setdb1flox/flox Nestin-cre- mice are the wild-type (i.e. WT)mice. Then, the ganglionic\neminence (GE) of E15.5 embryonic KO and WT mice is collected, and the neuralprogenitor cells\n(NPCs) obtained are cultured on ultra-low attachment plates for Hi-C, ChIP-seq, RNAseq and\nimmunofluorescence experiments. Results (1) 3D genomic compartment and structure changed\nwhen Setdb1 loss, significant increase of compartment counts in the 3D genome, A and B\ncompartments switched, the cis interactions between A and B compartments were significantly\nreduced, while the cis interactions between A and A compartments, and between B and B\ncompartments were significantly increased. (2) H3K9me3 up and hp1-alpha was enriched in\nheterochromatin when Setdb1 loss. (3) hp1-alpha may phase separation when Setdb1 loss.\nConclusion The absence of SETDB1 breaks the restriction of H3K9me3 to hp1-alpha in\neuchromatin, since hp1-alpha has been reported to generate phase separation on its own, it is\npossible that free hp1-alpha is recruited by phase separation in heterochromatin and forms\ncomplexes with histone methyltransferases in heterochromatin to mediate the formation of\nrepressive histone modification-H3K9me3 then affect 3D genome structure.\nKeywords:Setdb1, H3K9me3, hp1-alpha, phase separation, Neurodevelopment", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051420354656.pdf"}, {"title": "Gyral-enriched SPON1 promotes axonal growth underlies gyrification", "text": "Gyral-enriched SPON1 promotes axonal growth underlies\ngyrification\nJunyang Chen\nFudan University\nThe intricate folding patterns of the mammalian neocortex are believed to be pivotal for the\nenhanced cognitive capabilities observed in humans.

The therapeutic potential of dopamine (DA) neuron\ntransplantation in Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been validated, prompting clinical pilot studies\nworldwide.

Preliminary single-cell RNA sequencing revealed stage-\nspecific pathway enrichment: early-phase grafts (1 month post-transplantation, 1MPT) showed\npredominant activation of population size-regulating gene networks, mid-phase grafts (3MPT)\nexhibited synaptic formation and axonal projection-related functional enrichment, while late-phase\ngrafts (6MPT) demonstrated increased glial cells and fibroblast generation. Parallel in vivo\nelectrophysiological recordings demonstrated a significant developmental decline in the\nproportion of burst-firing neurons within grafted DA populations. These molecular and neural\ncircuit-level findings collectively establish a progressive maturation pattern of transplanted cells\nwithin host brains.

Hypoxia decreases energy generation in neurons\nand reduce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production because of injury to neuronal mitochondria.\nSince microglia was reported to transfer mitochondria to neurons in degenerative diseases and\nalleviate oxidative stress damage to neurons, this study was designed to see whether microglia\ncould rescue neurons by mitochondrial transfer in hypoxic injury and explore the mechanism\nunderlying.\nMethods: We compared the ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of primary microglia\nand neurons at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h of oxygen deprivation (OD), and observed mitochondrial\ntransfer between microglia and neurons in contact co-culture by MitoTracker and phalloidine\nlabeling mitochondria and tunneling nano-tubes (TNTs). Mior1, a key protein affecting\nmitochondria moving along the microtubes was detected in OD exposed microglia by western blot,\nand Mior1 reducer was used to verify the role of Miro1 in mitochondrial transfer during OD\nprocess. To capture the evidence of mitochondrial transfer from microglia to neurons in vivo, we\ntansplanted microglia that were pre-labeled mitochondria to the cortex of the mice, and exposed\nthe animal to 10% oxygen for 24 h, then collect the brain slice to see if the pre-labeled\nmitochondria distribute to the adjacent neurons by confocal microscopy.\nResults: Microglia appeared more tolerant to hypoxia than neurons as shown by lower level of\nROS at the early time point of OD. At 6 h of OD exposure, microglia still can transfer\nmitochondria to neurons via TNTs and increased the ATP production of neurons. The expression\nof Mior1 decreased as ROS level was elevated in microglia exposed to OD for 12 h, which\nresulted in less mitochondrial transfer from microglia to neurons. Mior1 reducer impeded this\nprocessing of mitochondrial transfer at earlier time point. In vivo experiments showed that the\nmitochondria derived from transplanted microglia can be detected in the nearby neurons in the\ncortex of the mice exposed to hypoxia.\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that microglia be able to rescue neurons by transferring\nmitochondria in response to hypoxic conditions, and hypoxia induced ROS may decline this\nmitochondrial transfer by down regulated Miro1 as OD continues.

Central\nsensitization, a core feature of chronic pain, encompasses maladaptive neuroplastic changes from\nspinal cord to the brain, including neuronal hyperexcitability and long-term potentiation (LTP) of\nsynaptic transmission, resulting in the formation of persistent “pain memory”. However, the\ncellular and molecular underpinnings of this process remain unclear. Inspired by classical memory\nresearch, we investigated chronic pain mechanisms from the perspective of sensory imprint. Using\ncomplete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain and spared nerve injury\n(SNI)-induced neuropathic pain models, we identified a subset of c-Fos+ neurons in layer II/III of\nthe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that were robustly activated during chronic pain, accompanied\nby dendritic spine remodeling. Through the strategy of targeted recombination in active\npopulations (TRAP), we captured these pain-responsive neuronal ensembles and demonstrated\ntheir functional relevance using chemogenetic manipulation, which significantly altered\nnociceptive behaviors. Given the critical role of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) in\nACC-mediated synaptic plasticity and pain processing, we further explored whether ASIC1a is\ninvolved in the formation of pain imprints. We observed that global ASIC1a knockout mice\nexhibited attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced c-Fos+ neuronal proportion in the\nACC, implicating ASIC1a’s essential role in recruiting pain imprints.

They are selectively enriched in brain\nregions associated with high-order cognitive functions, and implicated in\nvarious neurodegenerative diseases. While previous studies suggest that\nVENs may function as specialized extratelencephalic-projecting pyramidal\ncells (ET-PCs), their precise electrophysiological and transcriptomic\ncharacteristics remain unclear. Here, we performed whole cell patch-clamp\nrecording together with single-cell sequencing (Patch-seq) of visually\nidentified VENs and PCs in acute human cortical slices, and found that VENs\npossess a distinctive electrophysiological phenotype and a unique molecular\nsignature. Distinct from ET-PCs, VENs exhibited heightened excitability and\nprolonged persistent firing in response to step current injections. VENs\nshowed an enrichment in immune-related pathways and a downregulation of\ngenes involved in synaptic transmission and axonal projection. Moreover,\ntranscriptomic profiling uncovered heterogeneity within the VEN population,\nwith subtypes mapping to either intratelencephalic-projecting (IT) or ET-PC\ntranscriptomic defined clusters. Together, our findings establish VENs as a\nspecialized and heterogeneous neuronal population that, despite sharing core\nmolecular markers with ET-PCs, are distinguishable across morphological,\nphysiological, and transcriptomic dimensions. Their distribution in\nfrontal ,temporal and insular lobes, along with their unique electrical properties\nand molecular features, suggests that VENs may fulfill specialized functions in\ncognition, social behavior, and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nKeywords: VENs; human; temporal cortex; ET-PCs; IT-PCs", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051510533311.pdf"}, {"title": "Positional activation of TREK-1 by membrane thickness", "text": "Positional activation of TREK-1 by membrane thickness\nScott B.

Recently ordered lipids emerged as one of the mechanical sensors within the\nmembrane. Force disrupts ordered lipids allowing proteins, including TWIK-related potassium\nchannel 1 (TREK-1), to move between ordered and disordered regions of the membrane, which\ndiffer in hydrophobic thickness.

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying vestibular compensation also offers promising\ntherapeutic avenues for treating vestibular disorders. While most studies have focused on the dynamics of\nGABAergic synaptic plasticity and intrinsic cellular adaptations in the ipsilesional medial vestibular\nnucleus (MVN) after unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL), the role of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in this\nprocess remains largely unexplored. Here, we employed Golgi staining, immunofluorescence, whole-cell\npatch-clamp recordings, and behavioral assessments to examine the structural and functional dynamics of\nglutamatergic synapses during vestibular compensation. Our results reveal rapid structural and functional\nplasticity of glutamatergic transmission in response to UL. Specifically, dendritic spine density and\nmorphology in the ipsilesional MVN recovered to baseline levels within 6 to 24 h post-UL. Furthermore,\nUL-induced postsynaptic depression of glutamatergic synaptic strength, reflected by a reduced\nAMPA/NMDA ratio, was reversed within 24 h, likely due to an upregulation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA\nreceptors. In contrast, presynaptic glutamate release probability, as indicated by a reduced frequency of\nspontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, was not fully compensated during this period. These results\nsuggest that while presynaptic properties recover more slowly in ipsilesional MVN neurons following UL,\npostsynaptic glutamatergic transmission undergoes rapid structural and functional reorganization. The\nfindings highlight glutamatergic synaptic plasticity as a critical driver for vestibular compensation and\nsuggest that pharmacological interventions targeting these mechanisms may accelerate functional recovery,\noffering potential therapeutic avenues for vestibular disorders.

In this study, we established an acute itch model through intradermal (i.d.) injection of \nimperatorin (IMP) into the neck or cheek of both male and female mice. I.d. injection of IMP into \nthe nape of the neck elicited a robust, dose dependent scratching behavior that was independent of \nhistamine. Additionally, injection of IMP into the cheek induced both scratching and wiping \nbehaviors. Furthermore, IMP induced an up -regulation of phosphorylation of extracellular signa l \nregulated kinases (p-ERK) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and the scratching behaviors were \nsuppressed by the deficiency of transient receptor potential ion channel V1 (TRPV1).

TRPC3 and TRPC6 proteins, coassembling as heterotetrameric channels, are highly\nexpressed in sensory neurons. However, how these channels mediate mechanical pain\nhypersensitivity has remained elusive. It is shown that in mice and human, TRPC3 and TRPC6 are\nupregulated in DRG and spinal dorsal horn under pathological states. Double knockout of\nTRPC3/6 blunts mechanical pain hypersensitivity, largely by decreasing nociceptor\nhyperexcitability and spinal synaptic potentiation via presynaptic mechanism. In corroboration\nwith this, nociceptor-specific ablation of TRPC3/6 produces comparable pain relief. Mechanistic\nanalysis reveals that upon peripheral inflammation, TRPC3/6 in primary sensory neurons get\nrecruited via released bradykinin acting on B1/B2 receptors, facilitating BDNF secretion from\nspinal nociceptor terminals, which in turn potentiates synaptic transmission through TRPC3/6 and\neventually results in mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Antagonizing TRPC3/6 in DRG relieves\nmechanical pain hypersensitivity in mice and nociceptor hyperexcitability in human. Thus,\nTRPC3/6 in nociceptors is crucially involved in pain plasticity and constitutes a promising\ntherapeutic target against mechanical pain hypersensitivity with minor side effects.\nKeywords：TRPC3; TRPC6; mechanical pain hypersensitivity; nociceptor; synaptic potentiation", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060614384974.pdf"}, {"title": "Functional cell types in the mouse dLGN and the effect of SC on dLGN function", "text": "Functional cell types in the mouse dLGN and the effect of \nSC on dLGN function \nXiao-Ying MA，Biao Y AN*,  Jia -Yi ZHANG* \nState Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, MOE Frontiers Center for Brain Science, \nInstitutes of Brain Science, 11 Institute for Medical and Engineering Innovation, Department of \nOphthalmology 12 and Vision Science, Eye & ENT Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, \nChina. \n*Corresponding author  \nE-mail: biaoyan@fudan.edu.cn \nAbstract: Objective The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) serves as a critical relay center \nin the visual system, receiving input from the retina and projecting to the primary visual cortex. \nHowever, functomics of dLGN neurons and the specific properties of each class remain unclear. \nPrevious studies have shown that certain neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) project directly to \nthe dLGN and are involved in visual information integration. Yet, it is not well understood how \nSC input modulates the functional properties of dLGN neurons from an electrophysiological \nperspective. Methods Using multi-channel electrodes, we recorded the neural activity of dLGN \nneurons in anesthetized mice in response to a wide range of visual stimuli. Unsupervised \nclustering was applied to classify dLGN neurons based on their functional response profiles. To \nassess the influence of SC input, we locally injected muscimol into the SC and repeated recordings \nin the same animals for comparative analysis.

The present study aimed to elucidate the \nextent of polygenic overlap and identify functionally relevant shared genomic loci between these \ntraits. Methods GWAS summary statistics for a composite pain phenotype—including limb, back, \nneck, head, and abdominal pain—were obtained from the FinnGen R12 release (N = 500,348), \nrepresenting common forms of chronic somatic pain.

However, the\nneurobiological mechanisms underlying pain processing abnormalities in ASD remain poorly\nunderstood. Notably, neuroimaging studies consistently identify structural and functional\nalterations in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of ASD patients. The ventrolateral orbital cortex\n(VLO), a subregion of the OFC, exerts top-down pain modulation through glutamatergic\nprojections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a midbrain nucleus essential for\nproducing analgesic effects. DOCK4 is a ASD risk gene located at 7q31.1, and Dock4 knockout\n(KO) mice exhibit ASD-like core behaviors. We recently identified that this mouse model also\ndisplays mechanical allodynia. The present study aims to elucidate the mechanism by which\nDOCK4 regulates nociception. Methods DREADDs-based chemogenetic technology was used to\nmanipulate neuronal excitability. The paw withdrawal threshold was measured by von Frey Test.\nPatch clamp technique was used to record the changes of neuronal function in Layer 5 pyramidal\nneurons in VLO. Results (1) Dock4 KO mice showed decreased paw withdrawal threshold,\nindicating mechanical allodynia. (2) Dock4 in excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory neurons,\nregulates mechanical nociception. (3) Whole-cell recording on vlPAG-projecting pyramidal\nneurons (PNVLO →vlPAG) showed markedly reduced excitation in Dock4 KO mice.

However, whether  PPI behavior is abnormal in PD \nand its underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Methods and Results : This study \ndemonstrated that administration of the neurotoxin MPTP to induce selective loss of SNc \ndopaminergic neurons could directly trigger PPI behavioral deficits, while activating these neurons \nalleviated MPTP-induced PPI dysfunction. Using viral tracing techniques, it was revealed that SNc \ndopaminergic neurons receive glutamatergic input projections from the inferior colliculus (IC), \nforming an IC-SNc circuit. Bidirectional modulation of the IC-SNc circuit could mimic or reverse \nMPTP-induced PPI behavioral deficits. Furthermore, after MPTP -induced damage to SNc \ndopaminergic neurons, neuronal activity in the reticulotegmental nucleus (RtTg), a key brain region \nfor PPI behavioral responses of the acoustic startle reflex, was significantly elevated during PPI \nbehavior, suggesting that SNc dopaminergic neurons may regulate PPI behavior via the RtTg. \nConclusions: In summary, this study reveals th e role of SNc dopaminergic neurons and their \nupstream IC-SNc circuit in PPI behavior and elucidates the neural circuit mechanisms underlying \nimpaired PPI behavior in early-stage PD mouse models. \nKey words: Parkinson’s disease; Prepulse inhibition; Acoustic startle reflex; IC-SNc circuit", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051423565526.pdf"}, {"title": "CRH-expressing neurons in the central amygdala orchestrate maternal behaviours during parturition", "text": "CRH-expressing neurons in the central amygdala \norchestrate maternal behaviours during parturition \nGui-Ling Li1#, Qi Zheng1#, Ben-Long Liu1*  \n \n1 State Key Laboratory of Medical neurobiology and MOE Frontiers center for Brain Science, \nInstitutes of Brain Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China. \n \n*Correspondence author \n \nE-mail: liu_b@fudan.edu.cn   \n \nAbstract \nObjective: Maternal behavior is essential for the survival and well -being of offspring. While \npostpartum maternal care has been extensively studied, the neural regulation of maternal behaviours \nduring parturition remains largely unexplored due to limitations in animal models .

This study aims to explore whether \nbrain CRH neurons, particularly those in the central amygdala (CeA), regulate maternal behaviours \nduring parturition. \nMethods: We focused on maternal behaviours exhibited around the time of parturition and \nmonitored the activity of CeACRH neurons using c-Fos immunostaining, in vivo calcium imaging \nand extracellular electrophysiological recordings . To causally test the involvement of CeA CRH \nneurons in maternal behaviours, we employed optogenetic and chemogenetic strategies as well as \ngenetic mouse models, and assessed behavioural outcomes in parturient mice. \nResults: (1) Activation of CeA CRH neurons facilitated maternal behaviour during labour  and \nsignificantly improved neonatal survival.

It is frequently\nemployed to investigate the mechanisms by which the cerebral cortex controls muscle activities.\nHowever, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are highly susceptible to external environmental\ninterference, resulting in poor signal quality and raising concerns about the reliability of research\nfindings.Methods In this study, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane to induce unconsciousness.\nMeanwhile, the primary motor cortex (M1 area) of the left brain was electrically stimulated with\nsquare waves, sine waves, triangular waves at a frequency of 20 Hz and a stimulation intensity\nranging from 0.1 to 1.3 mA to directly activate the neurons. Electromyogram (EMG) signals of the\ncontralateral triceps brachii, the end - control muscle, were collected. The same procedures were\nrepeated when the rats were in a conscious state. The mutual information between the EMG\nsignals and electrical stimulation signals in the delta (0.1-5 Hz), alpha (5-15 Hz), beta (15-35 Hz),\nand gamma (50-75 Hz) bands, as well as the energy changes of EMG signals across different\nbands, were analyzed and calculated. Results (1) In both states, the delta band occupied the most\nenergy (0.092±0.0118 mV²/Hz) but transmitted the least information (0.055±0.0067 bits). In\ncontrast, the alpha band used relatively little energy (0.0019±0.0002 mV²/Hz) to transmit more\ninformation (0.1146±0.1066 bits). The beta band utilized energy (0.0479±0.0042 mV²/Hz) to\ntransmit (0.1263±0.0907 bits) of information, and the gamma band used energy (0.0162±0.0016\nmV²/Hz) to transmit (0.0806±0.0562 bits) of information. (2) The EMG energy exhibited a trend\nof increasing initially and then leveling off as the amplitude of square - wave stimulation\nincreased, and the same trend was observed in the conscious state. Conclusion These results\nindicate that the alpha band plays a dominant role in the transmission of movement intentions\nfrom the M1 area to the triceps brachii, followed by the delta band. The firing frequency of\nneurons increases with the enhancement of stimulation intensity, and there exists a maximum\nthreshold. This study directly stimulates the primary motor cortex of rats, circumventing the\nproblem of poor quality of electroencephalogram signals. It proves the transmission mechanism of\nmovement intentions and validates the results of previous studies, providing a theoretical basis for\nthe development of new neural rehabilitation treatment methods.\nKeywords: Cortico-muscular coherence; Electromyography; Mutual information; Movement\nintention", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061315243195.pdf"}, {"title": "Modulation of Neuropathic Pain by Glutamatergic Neurons in the Lateral Habenula", "text": "Modulation of Neuropathic Pain by Glutamatergic Neurons in \nthe Lateral Habenula \n \nHuichao Sun1,2, Qiyuan Wang1,2, Junying Bao1,2, Zhifeng, Wu1,2, Xiya Jin1,2, Tao Liu1,2* \n \n1 Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital, Jiangxi Medical Hospital, Nanchang \nUniversity, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China \n2Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burn and Pain Medicine, the First Affiliated \nHospital, Jiangxi Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China \n \n*Corresponding author \n \nliutao1241@ncu.edu.cn \n \nAbstract: Objective The lateral habenula (LHb) is a small structure located posteromedially to the \ndorsal thalamus. As a key neuroanatomical hub, the lateral habenular nucleus plays a crucial role in \nmodulating various behavioral responses, including pain, stress, anxiety, sleep, and reward. The \nLHb is predominantly composed of glutamatergic neurons whose functions vary depending on the \nencountered stimuli.

Here, we show that social companionship motivates both innate-driven and experience-dependent explorations. Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTADA neurons), functioning as a critical intersection crosslinking social activity and exploration, determine exploration-decision by encoding both risky vigilance (via phasic firing) and exploration motivation (via tonic firing). VTADA neurons project to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) via both direct and indirect pathways, where the direct VTADA-BLA projection suppresses exploration through DA-D1 receptor (D1R) transmission, while the indirect pathway, intermediated by DA-D2R transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex, mediates social encouragement on exploration. Both pathways converge onto the same population of BLAD1R neurons, where they coordinately and competitively integrate to encode exploration decision. These findings establish VTADA neuron as a central hub and the firing pattern alteration-biased DA transmission in conjunctive VTADA-BLA projections as an integration mechanism encoding exploration decision, and define the indirect pathway as an intersection mediating social encouragement on exploration.

Although dysfunction within the \ncortico-striato-thalamic-cortical circuits has long been associated with OCD, the role of the thalamus  in OCD \npathogenesis remains highly understudied in the literature. Here, we identified a rat tha lamo-hypothalamic \npathway – linking the midline reuniens (NRe) to the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) – that mediates \npersistent, compulsive -like self -grooming behavior. Optogenetic activation of the thalamic NRe induce s \nrepetitive grooming that supersedes basic survival behaviors.  Moreover, NRe activation resulted in an aversive \nand anxiogenic phenotype akin to negative affect and anxiety -like states commonly associated with OCD \nmanifestations. The NRe-PMd pathway was discovered to mediate excessive self-grooming behavior and render \nit a defensive coping response to stress, mirroring the obsessions faced by OCD patients. Given the close \nresemblance between this self-grooming behavior and the clinical manifestations of OCD, the results from this \nstudy highlight the role of NRe in mediating OCD-like behaviors. This can be attributed to the NRe's position at \nthe nexus of an extensive frontal -striato-thalamic network regulating cognition, emotion, an d stress -related \nbehaviors, suggesting the NRe as a potential novel target for intervention. \n \nKeywords: Self-grooming; nucleus reuniens; dorsal premammillary nucleus; compulsive behavior \n \nGrant Support: HMRF Grant 09203236; HKRGC-GRF Grant 14115821; HKRGC-CRF Grant C4012-22GF; \nHKRGC-CRF Grant C6034-21G; CityU SGP Grant 9380157", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051521244511.pdf"}, {"title": "Multimodal Mesoscopic Dissection of Motor Coordination Mechanisms in Midbrain Neural Circuits", "text": "Multimodal Mesoscopic Dissection of Motor Coordination \nMechanisms in Midbrain Neural Circuits \nYu-xiao LI1, Miao REN1, Qing-ming LUO1, Hui GONG2, Jia-xi HU1* \n1 Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, School of Biomedical \nEngineering, Hainan University, Sanya, China. \n2 HUST-Suzhou Institute for Brainsmatics, JITRI, Suzhou, China.  \n*Corresponding author \nE-mail: hujx93@163.com \nAbstract: The precise execution of motor behaviors relies on the dynamic coordination \nof multi -level neural circuits, whose dysfunction is closely associated with motor \ndeficits in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), including \nbradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability.

Proper fear modulation allows individuals to maintain adaptive behavioral responses in\nthe face of threat and safety, whereas dysfunction in these processes is closely associated with\npsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The insular cortex, an\nimportant hub for integrating emotional and interoceptive information, has recently gained\nattention for its role in maintaining fear balance. This study focuses on a population of neurons in\nthe insula that express the Tachykinin 1 (Tac1) gene, aiming to elucidate their specific function\nand underlying neural mechanisms in fear extinction.Using behavioral assays, optogenetic\nmanipulations, and calcium imaging, we found that Tac1+ neurons in the insular cortex exhibit\ndistinct activity patterns during fear extinction. Functionally, activation of these neurons\nsignificantly facilitated the extinction of fear memory, whereas their inhibition impaired this\nprocess. Further molecular and electrophysiological analyses revealed that Tac1+ neurons are\nGABAergic, suggesting that they may modulate fear responses through inhibitory control of local\nor distal targets.Circuit tracing experiments demonstrated that insular Tac1+ neurons receive input\nfrom multiple sensory-related brain regions and project to downstream areas such as the nucleus\naccumbens and lateral entorhinal cortex, both of which are involved in emotion, motivation, and\nmemory processing.

Separately, scientists have found some mechanism under the representation of these information, such as the crucial role of hippocampus in the spatial navigation. However, how animals integrate these information and make decision is still unclear. The present study is to explore how reward representation is involved into the spatial task and affect animal’s decision. Methods We have developed two new behavior paradigms with varying doses and probability of reward based on the classical Tolman’s detour maze. In one paradigm mice could get different volume of reward through three different paths: direct, short detour & long detour. In another paradigm mice could get same volume of reward but in different probability through three paths. Meanwhile, neuronal activities of hippocampus dorsal CA1 neurons were recorded by tet132rodes in vivo. Results On behavior: (1) When mice could get several folders of regular reward volume for the direct path, mice preferentially chosen either detour paths. This preference is partially reversible when the volume change back even. Intriguingly, a nonlinear relationship between the choice of volume and the distance seems could be found.  (2) Discrepancy in reward probability could also cause the preference in mice’s choice, low chance of getting reward could lead to a large prediction error and affect mice’s preference strongly.  On hippocampal neuronal activities: Place cells are recorded and all of the population were used to do the Bayesian decoding to estimate the position. Theta sequence was detected in all trials that in a theta cycle the decoded position extend ahead of mouse’s real position sequentially. Awake replays in sharp wave ripples were also found during the task, most events were found in reward zone. Further study will examine how these hippocampal sequential activity, imbedded in the sharp wave ripples and the theta sequence, contribute to animal’s navigation planning or decision.

Given the analgesic potential of music intervention, this study aims to delineate the neural circuits interfacing auditory processing and visceral pain modulation. Methods Experiments were performed on male C57BL/6 mice with neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI, a model of visceral hypersensitivity) alongside their littermate controls. Visceral pain responses were assessed by electromyography (EMG) recordings combined with optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulation of selective neurons. Neuronal activity was evaluated using immunofluorescence and fiber photometry. Results NCI-induced visceral hypersensitivity was associated with suppressed activity of Au1 GABAergic (Au1GABA) neurons, and chemogenetic inhibition of Au1GABA was sufficient to induce visceral hyperalgesia in naïve mice. Anterograde tracing identified anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a potential downstream effector of Au1-mediated visceral pain modulation, wherein hyperactivity of ACC glutamatergic (ACCGlu) neurons drove visceral hypersensitivity in NCI mice. Monosynaptic retrograde tracing using rabies virus further delineated dual presynaptic inputs to ACCGlu from Au1GABA and Au1 glutamatergic (Au1Glu) neurons, with both pathways modulating visceral pain. Notably, music alleviated visceral pain through activation of Au1GABA and inhibition of ACCGlu. Conclusion Our findings illustrate a novel Au1-ACC cortico-cortical circuit underlying cross-modal visceral pain modulation, providing mechanistic insights for clinical translation of music therapy in visceral pain management.

Previous studies\ndemonstrate that pupil diameter positively correlates with activity levels of lateral hypothalamic\norexinergic neurons (LHOrx) and locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons (LCNE).

Emerging research indicates that various cortical regions significantly contribute to memory, highlighting the need for detailed neural mapping. This study aims to provide a comprehensive mapping of the neuronal inputs to the CA1 region to gain deeper insights into memory coordination. Methods The study utilized rabies viral vectors to trace excitatory neurons connected to the hippocampal CA1. Brain tissues were sectioned and imaged to map neuronal input regions. QuPath and ABBA software were used to quantify labelled cells, and specific laminar layers and AP coordinates that transmit signals to CA1 were identified. Results Analysis revealed that over 50% of neuronal inputs to CA1 originate locally within the hippocampus, specifically from CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus. the CA1 also receive major projection from cortical regions including the entorhinal cortex, with both medial and lateral parts showing distinct connections. Other regions such as the retrosplenial and perirhinal cortices exhibit significant ipsilateral connectivity with CA1. We extended our investigation to the perirhinal cortex, employing the same tracing technique to disynaptically map the upstream regions of the perirhinal cortex that project to the CA1 region.

Previous studies hypothesized that N-terminal pyroglutamic acid (pQ) in ligands might enhance receptor activity by stabilizing ligand conformation, prolonging its half-life, or improving receptor affinity, though direct evidence remains lacking. Here, during the identification of PRXamide neuropeptide receptors in Aplysia californica, we found that the N-terminal pQ of the endogenous neuropeptide MMG2-pDPb exerted opposing regulatory effects on two receptor subtypes (ApPRXa-R1 and ApPRXa-R2)—significantly suppressing MMG2-pDPb’ ApPRXa-R1 activity while enhancing MMG2-pDPb’ ApPRXa-R2 activity. This finding provides a unique opportunity for deciphering PTM-mediated structure-activity relationship. Molecular docking suggested that pQ did not directly participate in ligand-receptor interactions but regulated the ligand conformation, redistributing interaction patterns without altering binding residues in the receptor, thereby forming an activation-favorable conformation in ApPRXa-R2 while inducing an inhibitory conformation in ApPRXa-R1. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis and ligand alanine-scanning validated these predictions. Evolutionary analysis showed that ApPRXa-R1 clustered closely with molluscan PRXamide/NmU receptors, relying on a conserved pQ-independent binding mode while retaining broad-spectrum ligand responsiveness. In contrast, ApPRXa-R2 exhibited multiple positively selected residues, likely evolving more complex functions with higher structural specificity. In conclusion, our study provides a novel experimental and computational model in Aplysia for understanding the mechanisms of ligand’s N-terminal PTMs interacting with its receptor. The findings might be useful in designing subtype-selective therapeutics as well.

Methods Western blot was used to detect the protein level of HCN1-4. Virus-mediated manipulation of HCN2 and HCN3 in the VTA was done. The open field test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test was used to evaluate the anxiety-like behaviors. Results (1) Morphine withdrawal induced depression-like behaviors and upregulation of HCN2 and HCN3 in the VTA. (2) Virus-mediated overexpression of HCN2 or HCN3 was sufficient to induce depressive-like behaviors. Additionally, overexpression of HCN2 induced upregulation of HCN3 and overexpression of HCN3 induced upregulation of HCN2 in the VTA. (3) Knockdown of HCN3 in the VTA ameliorated depressive-like behaviors and reduced HCN2 protein expression. Meanwhile, knockdown of HCN2 in the VTA alleviated depressive like behaviors and reduced HCN3 expression. (4) Overexpression of HCN3 in the GABAergic neurons induced depressive-like behaviors and upregulation of HCN2. (5) Overexpression of HCN2 in the GABAergic neurons induced depressive-like behaviors and upregulation of HCN3. Conclusion The upregulation of HCN2 and HCN3 in GABAergic neurons within the VTA may cooperatively contribute to depression-like behaviors induced by morphine withdrawal in male mice.

Compared with humans, LLMs have demonstrated greater efficiency and accuracy in \nknowledge-based task processing. As one of the core tasks in NLP, emotion recognition plays an \nirreplaceable role in various domains such as mental health assessment, customer service \noptimization, and marketing strategy development. However, the accuracy of LLMs in recognizing \nand classifying emotion words in specific corpora has not yet been fully validated. This study \nevaluates three representative LLMs—Doubao, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4—by conducting emotion \nword recognition and cla ssification experiments on ten bilingual news texts. The outputs of the \nmodels were compared with manual labeling data. The results indicate that GPT -4 significantly \noutperformed Doubao and DeepSeek-R1 in overall accuracy (0.49) and cross -lingual consistency \n(0.81), although it exhibited a lower recall rate. Notably, none of the three LLMs were able to \nsuccessfully identify neutral emotion words in the corpus, revealing a shared shortcoming when \nprocessing emotionally neutral text. The above findings reveal the limitations of existing LLMs in \ncapturing emotional semantic nuances and modeling neutral emotional words, and provide a \nreference for improving the model effect by fine -tuning semantic inference subtasks and \nconstructing multi-level emotional dictionaries. \n \nKeywords: Large Language Models, Emotion Recognition, Emotion Classification, Neutral \nEmotion Words", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051419292811.pdf"}, {"title": "The role and mechanism of CaMKII in the VTA involved in anxiety-like behaviors induced by morphine withdrawal", "text": "The role and mechanism of CaMKII in the VTA involved in\nanxiety-like behaviors induced by morphine withdrawal\nChen-Chen ZHU 1, 2, #, Deng-Jun MIN 1, 2, #, Yu-Zhu WANG1, 2, #, Si-Si LI 1, 2, Yong-Li LU 1, 2,\nHong-Wei YANG 1, 2, Xia-Chun LI 1, 2, Zi-Cheng LI 1, 2, *\n1College of Basic Medical Sciences, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China\n2Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy, China\nThree Gorges University, Yichang, China\n*Corresponding author\n#These authors contributed equally to this article.\nE-mail: zichengli@ctgu.edu.cn\nAbstract: Objective To study the role and mechanism of CaMKII in the VTAin regulating\nanxiety induced by morphine withdrawal.

Previous studies have revealed that the locus coeruleus (LC) not\nonly demonstrates potential structural sexual dimorphism but may also play a regulatory role in\nbinge-like drinking behavior. Therefore, we propose that noradrenergic (NE) neurons in the LC\nundergo neuroadaptive changes following binge-like alcohol consumption, and such\nneuroplasticity exhibit sexual dimorphism. This study aims to investigate sex differences in\nLC-mediated binge-like drinking behavior and their underlying neural mechanisms. Methods:\nUsing the drinking-in-the-dark (DID) model, we measured sex differences in alcohol consumption\nbetween male and female mice. Patch clamp techniques were used to explore changes in the\nelectrophysiological properties of LC NE neurons following binge-like drinking. Chemogenetic\napproaches were further applied to observe how activation of LC NE neurons affects alcohol\nconsumption in both sexes. Results: Under the DID paradigm, female mice demonstrated distinct\nconsumption patterns, consuming significantly more alcohol compared to male mice, whereas\nmales consumed more water; After 3 weeks of DID modeling, female mice exhibited enhanced\nexcitability of LC NE neurons, while male mice showed increased miniature inhibitory\npostsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in LC NE neurons; Chemogenetic activation of LC NE neurons\nsignificantly reduced both alcohol intake and alcohol preference in both sexes.

Emerging evidence from rodent models suggests that early-onset, long-term \nhigh-sugar consumption may impair motivational drive. However, these findings are constrained by \nthe limited behavioral paradigms used, leaving it unclear whether the observed deficits reflect a \ngeneralized reduction in motivation or are specific to certain types of behavior. In rodents, \ninstrumental actions can be broadly categorized as either goal-directed or habitual. To address this \ngap, the present study investigates whether prolonged sucrose overconsumption selectively affects \nmotivation in either behavioral domain, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how early-\nlife sugar intake influences motivational processes. Methods We established a juvenile high-sucrose \nintake model (high-sugar beverage, HSB) by providing rats with unrestricted access to a sucrose \nsolution starting at three weeks of age. Upon reaching adulthood, HSB rats were compared to control \nrats given access to plain water. To assess distinct motivational processes, we used random ratio (RR) \nand random interval (RI) reinforcement schedules to evaluate goal-directed and habitual behaviors, \nrespectively, along with additional behavioral assays. Results (1) In control rats, lever-pressing \nbehavior under the RR schedule was sensitive to outcome devaluation, indicating goal-directed \ncontrol, while behavior under the RI schedule was insensitive to devaluation, consistent with habitual \nresponding. (2) Rats with early high-sucrose intake exhibited reduced responding on the RI task, but \nnot on the RR task. (3) Rats with early high-sucrose intake performed normally on other behavioral \ntasks, including stimulus discrimination and reward-based and risk-based choice behaviors. \nConclusion Early-life excessive sucrose exposure may selectively impair motivation for habitual \nbehaviors in adult rats, while leaving motivation for goal-directed behaviors largely unaffected. \n \nKeywords: early-life; high-sugar; sucrose; motivation; goal-directed; habitual; rat", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051422333746.pdf"}, {"title": "Anxiogenic mechanisms of OX1R in the ventral tegmental area during morphine withdrawal", "text": "Anxiogenic mechanisms of OX1R in the ventral tegmental area\nduring morphine withdrawal\nHong-Wei YANG 1, 2 #, Si-Qi WEI 1, 2, #, Si-Si LI1, 2 #, Yu-Zhu WANG1, 2, Yong-Li LU 1, 2, Xia-Chun\nLI 1, 2, Chen-Chen ZHU1, 2, Zi-Cheng LI 1, 2, *\n1College of Basic Medical Sciences, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China\n2Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy, China\nThree Gorges University, Yichang, China\n*Corresponding author, E-mail: zichengli@ctgu.edu.cn\n#These authors contributed equally to this article.\nAbstract: Objective To elucidate the mechanisms of OX1R in the VTAin regulating morphine\nwithdrawal-induced anxiety.

The \nDG is primarily composed of excitatory granule cells (GCs), mossy cells (MCs), and inhibitory \ninterneurons. The diverse cell types and complex circuitry collaboratively shape its spatiotemporal \nactivity patterns. The precise roles of DG microcircuits in memory encoding and retrieval remain \nunclear, primarily due to challenges in distinguishing specific cell types and recording techniques. \nMethods We employed multi-channel in vivo electrophysiology (ephys) recording combined with \noptogenetics to specifically identify and record mossy cell activities in the DG during auditory fear \nmemory encoding and retrieval. Result (1) Using optogenetic tagging in combination with in vivo \nephys recordings, we identified 121 calretinin-positive (CR⁺) neurons—mossy cells—from 7 Calb2-\nCre mice. (2) Ephys analysis revealed that during CS presentation in the fear memory encoding \nphase, 38% of MCs showed significant CS-specific activation. Further analysis revealed that MCs \nfiring was strongly negatively correlated with freezing behavior in mice. At freezing onset, 85% of \nMCs exhibited significantly reduced firing rates, while only approximately 10% showed increases; \nat freezing offset, 82% of MCs increased firing, and only 13% showed decreases.

We investigated how temporal order of episodic memory in\nthe order of seconds is represented in the macaque precuneal neurons, focusing on population-level\nneural dynamics during memory retrieval in a temporal order judgement (TOJ) task. Methods\nMacaques were trained to view naturalistic videos and performed a temporal order judgement test.\nEach video consisted of two concatenated segments, and on each trial, monkeys judged which of two\nstill frames had appeared earlier in a specific video after 2-s or 1-min delay. We recorded spiking\nactivity from chronically implanted neurons in the precuneu. Trials were categorised by the temporal\nlocation of the TOJ frames within the original videos. We applied neural manifold learning via PCA to\nreduce the high-dimensional firing rate data into a low-dimensional memory subspace. This allowed us\nto visualise and quantify the neural geometry of different task phases and to assess how temporal\ninformation is coded during TOJ. We also examined how the coding evolved and their relationship\nwith the animals’ memory performance. Results Firstly, memory subspace trajectories revealed clear\nseparation among the four task phases, with within-phase clustering and a continuous progression that\nrespected the trial’s temporal structure. In both 2-s and 1-min conditions, temporal locations were not\ndifferentiable during the delay period but became increasingly separable after TOJ onset as the\nmonkeys started to retrieve memories. Trajectories corresponding to different temporal locations\nexhibited maximal neural distance from one another at approximately 2.3 s after TOJ onset, and the age\nof memories systematically modulated this separation. These distinctions were absent in incorrect trials,\nsuggesting a behaviourally relevant neural correlate. Importantly, such distinctions were observable in\nthe geometry of population dynamics in the memory subspace but not from individual neuron firing\nrates. We further quantified neural distances as a function of temporal locations in memory and\nconfirmed a dynamic encoding process unique to the TOJ phase. Conclusion Temporal memory in the\nprecuneal neurons is expressed through population dynamics rather than isolated neuron tuning.

However, recent studies on \naphantasia have challenged this view. Individuals with aphantasia subjectively report an inability to \nvoluntarily generate visual mental images despite being able to perform everyday cognitive tasks . \nIntriguingly, imagery content w as still decodable in their visual cortex , suggesting that neural \nrepresentation in this region  alone cannot explain  differences in subjective experience  between \ntypical imagers and aphantasics . To investigate this apparent paradox,  we compared voluntary \nimagery, veridical perception, and illusion between typical imagers and aphantasics using functional \nMRI. Participants viewed or imagined a leftward- or rightward-moving Gabor in the right periphery \n(the “ imagery field”), and maintain ed the image over a memory delay . To examine neural \nrepresentations of motion paths , we performed multivariate pattern analysis using support vector \nmachines in the early visual cortex (EVC) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) , both contralateral and \nipsilateral to the imagery field. For typical imagers, we observed persistent above-chance decoding \nperformance in both the contralateral EVC and IPS across all conditions. In contrast, for aphantasics, \nimagined motion path s were only decodable  in contralateral EVC  but not in  contralateral IPS . \nInterestingly, in both ipsilateral EVC and IPS, motion paths were decodable in both groups. These \n“involuntary” imagery representations  in ipsilateral regions likely explained preserved imagery \ndecoding in aphantasic EVC. Moreover, typical imagers showed significant positive functional \nconnectivity between the IPS (contralateral and ipsilateral) and contralateral EVC, whereas \naphantasics showed little connectivity between these regions. Together, these results suggest that \nthe aphantasia may be linked to IPS dysfunction in generating voluntary imagery content, as well \nas reduced connectivity between IPS and EVC. \n \nKeywords: Aphantasia; visual imagery; perception; illusion; connectivity; fMRI", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25052020393723.pdf"}, {"title": "Contribution of contextual embedding towards temporal memory representation", "text": "Contribution of contextual embedding towards temporal memory representation  Jiayu CHENG1, Ning SU3, Xiaobin ZHANG4, Yi YAO4, Ruyi YAO1, Sze Chai KWOK1, 2, 3, * 1 Phylo-Cognition Laboratory, Division of Natural and Applied Sciences, Duke Kunshan University, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Kunshan 215316, China 2 Duke Kunshan University - The First People's Hospital of Kunshan Joint Brain Sciences Laboratory, Kunshan 215300, China 3 Shanghai Key Laboratory of Brain Functional Genomics, Key Laboratory of Brain Functional Genomics (Ministry of Education), School of Psychology and Cognitive Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, China 4 Department of Functional Neurosurgery, Xiamen Humanity Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Xiamen 361009, China  *Corresponding author  E-mail: sze-chai.kwok@st-hughs.oxon.org   Abstract: Objective Temporal memory, the ability to integrate events occurring at different time points along with their order, constitutes a fundamental component of episodic memory function. This study investigates how temporal sequence memory is shaped by the macro-temporal context and the age of memories of encoded events, focusing on the variations in temporal distance and event structure and its underlying neural representations. Methods We recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from 9 epilepsy patients while they performed a three-day temporal order judgement (TOJ) task. On Days 1 and 2, participants encoded five videos per day (each composed of two distinct clips), with each video repeated five times, followed by a TOJ test using frame-based image pairs extracted from all 10 clips encoded that day. On Day 3, another TOJ test assessed temporal memory using image pairs sampled from all 20 previously encoded clips. This design yielded four trial types that differ in the contextual gap between the two probed moments: within-video (the two frames came from Clip 1 and Clip 2 of the same video), within-Day 1 or within-Day 2 (the frames were taken from different videos encoded on the same day), and across-day (one frame was selected from a Day 1 clip and the other from a Day 2 clip). Each frame pair was also assigned a clip-based temporal distance—the absolute gap between their clip positions in the fixed viewing order (range 1–19). We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to identify key behavioral predictors of TOJ accuracy, focusing on trial type and temporal distance. Neural analyses included hippocampal ripple detection and time–frequency analysis of high-gamma and theta power in the hippocampus and precuneus. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was further applied to characterize condition-specific differences in neural activity patterns. Results Participants showed above-chance TOJ accuracy on Day 3 (accuracy = 64.4%), significantly influenced by both trial type and temporal distance. GLM analysis revealed that greater temporal distance predicted higher accuracy (β = 0.16, p \\n< 0.001, OR = 1.18), with within-video trials yielding the highest odds of correct responses (OR = 6.17). After controlling for temporal distance, trial type remained a strong predictor of TOJ performance. Neural analyses revealed temporal distance modulations of ripple rate and oscillatory activity in the hippocampus and precuneus. Ripple rates varied significantly across trial types, with across-day trials showing the highest ripple rate and within-video trials the lowest; ripple events were also significantly more frequent on correct trials than on incorrect trials (ps < 0.05).  Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of trial type defined by their macro temporal structure and memory age in supporting  temporal order memory and their relationship with ripple and oscillatory dynamics in the hippocampal and precuneus activity.

Methods We investigated\nneural activity in three macaque monkeys (1 with electrophysiological recordings, 2 with fMRI)\nduring free episodic memory reconstruction tasks. Results Multi-modal analyses\n(electrophysiology, fMRI, and neuronal functional mapping) revealed five key findings: First,\nduring episodic reconstruction, dmPPC neurons exhibited significantly higher trial-to-trial\ncorrelation when reconstructing the same video compared to baseline activity. Second, a\nmulticlass SVM classifier applied to spiking activity (250ms time bins) during the reconstruction\nperiod identified a dmPPC subpopulation with sequential information accumulation patterns.\nThird, fMRI activation highlighted preferential engagement of the temporoparietal junction during\nreconstruction. Fourth, neuron’s functional map further demonstrated that 8.15% of dmPPC\nneurons exhibited single-trial decoding accuracy significantly above chance, distinguishing\nspecific video content under reconstruction.

Recent studies suggest divergent mechanisms: body neurons encode shared features across objects (Lappe et al., 2024), while face neurons rapidly switch encoding axes between detection and identification (Shi et al., 2023). Here, we investigate whether IT neurons employ similar encoding models for these tasks and explore influencing factors. Using fMRI-guided Neuropixels recordings in macaque IT (body, face, spiky regions), we built separate encoding models for between- and within-category selectivity for each units using feature derived from deep neural network. Body neurons used similar encoding axes for detection and discrimination, unlike face neurons, which switched axes for faces. However, face neurons processing bodies also maintained similar axes, suggesting axis switching is stimulus-dependent, not population-specific. Further analyses revealed that dissimilar encoding models arise from out-of-distribution generalization challenges. Testing synthetic stimuli (words, fake faces) confirmed that axis switching occurs when processing distributionally novel images, regardless of semantic labels. Our findings show that encoding models for body detection and discrimination are similar, unifying these functions under a single framework. Axis switching depends on image distribution properties, not just category selectivity, emphasizing the role of out-of-distribution generalization in neural encoding. Future work should explore how out-of-distribution representations emerge—whether through distinct pathways or feature dimensions.

While this distinction has been robust across languages and musical genres, it remains unclear whether the observed rhythmic timescales merely reflect acoustic properties or also encode communicative functions and cognitive development. In this study, we examined how temporal modulations vary across vocal expressions and over development, revealing a functional continuum between speech and music shaped by both expressive context and maturational changes. Methods To examine this, we analyzed a broad range of vocal productions, including canonical speech, sports command, city cries, expressive utterances (e.g., crying, sobbing, laughter), character-by-character reading, single-character interjections reading, and song. Additionally, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of speech and singing data from children aged 2 to adults to examine developmental changes in rhythmic structure. Results (1) Modulation spectrum analysis revealed that different vocal forms occupy intermediate positions along a speech–music continuum, rather than falling into discrete categories. For example, sports commands, city cries, and crying exhibited strong energy below 4 Hz, resembling music-like patterns. In contrast, character-by-character reading consistently peaked around 5 Hz, aligning more closely with typical speech. (2) Furthermore, the developmental analysis showed that slow temporal modulations (~0.5–1 Hz), which are prominent in adult music and expressive prosody, only become robust after the age of 10. This suggests that the ability to generate or process extended rhythmic structures is not innate but emerges gradually with neurocognitive and motor development. Conclusion These findings challenge the strict dichotomy between speech and music and highlight a shared temporal architecture that is graded across contexts and emerges with development. We propose that slow temporal modulations reflect not only acoustic features but also evolving capacities for affective, artistic, and rhythmic communication.

In this study, we examine how information from different sensory modalities is integrated using a naturalistic fMRI and MEG dataset. Methods Thirty participants (17 females, mean age=23.17±2.31 years) participated the fMRI experiment and an additional thirty participants (16 females, mean age=22.67±1.99 years) participated the MEG experiment. The video stimulus was extracted from a Chinese reality TV show with a total duration of 25 minutes and 19 seconds. We extracted the embeddings for the video frames, audio waveforms and all words in the stimuli from a multimodal LLM. These embeddings were then aligned with the BOLD signals at each voxel, time-locked to the onset of each word, using L2-regularized regression. A similar procedure was applied to the source-localized MEG data, where embeddings were regressed against neural activity at each source and time point, within a -100 ms to 500 ms window surrounding word onsets. Results Our findings revealed that the video-based embeddings showed strong alignment with neural responses in bilateral occipital regions. The audio embeddings exhibited significant alignment with bilateral superior temporal gyri. The text embeddings primarily aligned with left perisylvian language areas. Notably, the video embeddings also demonstrated robust alignment with this region, indicating the integration of multimodal information.

A standard \npipeline was developed to calculate the DTI-ALPS index enabling the assessment of glymphatic \nfunction. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between \nglymphatic activity and sleep quality, accounting for age-related brain atrophy.

Results The DTI-\nALPS index followed an inverse-U trajectory with age, peaking at approximately 50 years, with an \naverage of approximately 1.45 and comparable change rates on both hemispheres. Among the seven \nPSQI components, higher DTI-ALPS index was significantly associated with better habitual sleep \nefficiency (C4: r = -0.091, p = 0.032).

China *Corresponding author  Email:xyshen1107@126.com Abstract: Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairment and α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology, often accompanied by circadian rhythm disruptions and impaired glymphatic clearance.  High-frequency subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (HFS STN-DBS) has been proposed to address these deficits. Methods: AAV-A53T α-syn was overexpressed in the substantia nigra of mice to model PD.  Motor performance was assessed using open field, pole, and rotarod tests.  Astrocyte polarization (GFAP), aquaporin-4 (AQP4) localization, and α-syn deposition in the striatum and substantia nigra were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and western blotting.  Sleep architecture was evaluated via electroencephalography (EEG), and transcriptomic analysis was conducted to assess clock gene expression. Results: HFS STN-DBS partially restored motor function in A53T mice, reduced astrocyte polarization, and normalized AQP4 localization in both the substantia nigra and striatum, indicating improved glymphatic function.  It also reduced α-syn accumulation in these regions. EEG analysis showed that HFS STN-DBS reduced sleep fragmentation and increased total sleep time, particularly during the light phase.  Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant modulation of circadian rhythm-related genes, including Bmal1, Per2, and Cry1, aligning with AQP4 expression patterns. Conclusion: HFS STN-DBS modulates circadian rhythms and restores glymphatic function in a PD mouse model by reducing astrocyte polarization and α-syn accumulation in both the substantia nigra and striatum, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for slowing PD progression.

However, the intrinsic metabolic requirements of OLs \nduring development remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that OLs rely on aerobic \nglycolysis to support their lineage progression and influence central nervous system (CNS) \ndevelopment. Using Olig2 -Cre-driven deletion of Ldha, which encodes lactate dehydrogenase A \n(LDHA), a key enzyme in aerobic glycolysis, we show that disrupting aerobic glycolysis reduces \nOL numbers and myelin protein expression. Notably, LDHA -deficient oligodendrocyte precursor \ncells (OPCs) exhibit reduced proliferation, while LDHA -deficient post -differentiated OLs \nprematurely express late-stage OL genes. In a neonatal hypoxia-induced white matter injury model, \nLdha deletion blunts OPC differentiation but accelerates myelin generation, further supporting \ndisrupted timing of OL maturation. Strikingly, OL -specific Ldha deletion reduces neuronal \nsynaptic protein expression and alters glial cell composition, implicating OL metabolism in the \nbroader CNS developmental program. Together, our findings establish aerobic glycolysis as a \ncritical metabolic feature of the OL lineage, necessary not only for their intrinsic development and \nmyelination but also for regulating neuronal and glial maturation in the developing brain. \nTranscriptomic analyses, combined with in vivo and in vitro metabolic assays, reveal decreased \nNAD⁺ levels and a reduced NAD⁺/NADH ratio in LDHA -deficient OLs, accompanied by \ndysregulation of glycolytic and biosynthetic pathways.

The precise molecular mechanisms of how neutrophil-derived migrasomes\npromote thrombosis remain to be explored.\nAim:\nTo explore the role of neutrophil-derived migrasomes in cerebral thrombus formation, as well as\nthe underlying mechanisms.\nMethod:\nA total of 20 thrombi retrieved from endovascular thrombectomy were analyzed through\nimmunostaining. A thrombus model was constructed in male C57BL/6 mice, including wild-\ntype (WT) and Tspan9 conditional knockout (Tspan9fl/flElaneCre, TSPAN9 CKO) strains, using\nferric chloride.

Specifically, intrajugular injection of neutrophil-derived migrasomes in mice was shown to\npromote cerebral thrombus development. Conversely, inhibiting migrasome formation in\nneutrophils effectively suppressed cerebral thrombus formation and mitigated stroke outcomes in\nmice. Calcium ions are a key auxiliary factor in the coagulation process.

Ltd., Suzhou, China  Abstract Epilepsy, a common disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), manifests as recurrent episodes of brain dysfunction caused by large-scale synchronous abnormal discharges of neurons. Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. For the significant number of refractory epilepsy patients, targeted adjunctive therapies aimed at neuroinflammation offer promising new approaches. Thus, exploring novel treatment methods to enhance therapeutic efficacy is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Recent findings indicate that members of the FGF family influence epilepsy regulation; however, the protective effects of EGF and FGF on neuroinflammation following epilepsy remain underexplored. In our current study, we applied engineering enhanced EGF and FGF expression 293T-exosome (EGF-FGF.Exos) as treatment agent to investigate its action on the occurrence of the seizures. Pre-administration of EGF-FGF.Exos by tail-vein injection dose-dependently inhibited the occurrence of the acute seizures, as well as the high-frequency, high-amplitude electroencephalogram waves induced by PTZ in adult male mice. In vitro in cultured hippocampal neurons, EGF-FGF.Exos effectively blocked CTZ-induced epileptiform burst discharges and mitigated the reduction in mIPSC frequency caused by CTZ. In addition, in PTZ seizure mice model, EGF-FGF.Exos exhibited strong inhibitory effect on microglial activation and regulated microglial polarization towards the M2 phenotype while suppressing M1 polarization. RT-qPCR results demonstrated that EGF-FGF.Exos reduced the mRNA expression of central pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the animal model. HE staining showed that EGF-FGF.Exos pretreatment prevented neuronal loss in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in the acute PTZ epilepsy model. Further experiment demonstrated that pre-activation of the NF-κB pathway reversed the inhibitory effects of EGF-FGF.Exos on pro-inflammatory factor expression, microglial activation, and M1 polarization.  In conclusion, this current study demonstrated that engineered EGF-FGF enhancing exosomes (EGF-FGF.Exos) exhibit anti-epileptic effects in an acute PTZ-induced mouse model by suppressing NF-κB mediated inflammatory responses.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25052017570223.pdf"}, {"title": "Farrerol Confers Neuroprotection in Spinal Cord Injury by Regulating Microglial Polarization through the JAK2/STAT3 Pathway", "text": "Farrerol Confers Neuroprotection in Spinal Cord Injury by Regulating Microglial \nPolarization through the JAK2/STAT3 Pathway \nYue Chen 1,2, Lv Ren 1,2, Jin-Zhi Xia 1,3,Xue Song4,5, He-Zuo Lu3,4, Jian-Guo HU3,4* \n1Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bengbu Medical University, Bengbu, 233000, China  \n2Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical \nUniversity, Bengbu, Anhui, 233004, China \n3Department of Clinical Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University, \nBengbu, Anhui, 233004, China  \n4Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Basic and Translational Research of Inflammation-related \nDiseases, Bengbu, Anhui, 233004, China \n5Department of Central Laboratory , First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University, \nBengbu, 233000, China \n*Corresponding author \nE-mail: jghu9200@bbmc.edu.cn \nAbstract: \nObjective: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes secondary damage with neuroinflammation and \nimbalanced microglial polarization.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy shows neuroprotective potential, but its mechanisms are unclear. This study explored the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of HBO in a CFS mouse model using transcriptomic and metabolomic integration. Methods: C57 mice were assigned to control, CFS, and HBO groups. CFS was induced via 21-day multiple stressors. HBO (2.5 ATA, 60 min/day, 4 days/week) was applied for 3 weeks. Behavioral tests included tail suspension, open field, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition. Hippocampal injury and BBB integrity were assessed by histology and TEM. ELISA measured inflammatory cytokines. RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS metabolomics were used to detect differentially expressed genes and metabolites. Results: HBO improved behavioral performance, reduced neuronal damage, and preserved BBB integrity. It lowered pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL11) and elevated anti-inflammatory ones (IL-10, TGF-β). Metabolomics revealed recovery of disrupted glycerophospholipid metabolism. Transcriptomics showed enrichment in immune-related pathways (chemokine, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, cGMP–PKG). Integrated analysis identified CCL11 and glycerophospholipid metabolism as key HBO targets.

Our p revious studies using MDD animal \nmodels have revealed that pathological changes in oligodendrocytes (OL) and myelin sheath are \naccompanied by a significant reduction in the expression of hemoglobin subunit Hbb -b1 in the \ncallosum. Specific knockdown of Hbb -b1 in OL lineage cells lead  to OPC differentiation \nimpairment, mitochondrial dysfunction, and energy me tabolism disorders, as well as pathological \nmyelin sheath and depressive-like behaviors. Meanwhile, significant changes occurred in hypoxia-\ninducible factor 1α（HIF-1α）,heme synthesis and iron homeostasis, including hepci din (HEPC) \nand its sole ligand ferroportin 1 (FPN1), which is regulated by HIF-1α.

Alternatively, mice received BHB (5 g/kg/day) or\nvehicle post-MCAO. GS function was assessed via brain section analysis, transcranial\nmacroimaging, two-photon in vivo imaging, and MRI. Cerebral edema and infarct volume were\nquantified by MRI. AQP4 polarization and Histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at the\nSnta1 enhancer region were analyzed by immunofluorescence and chromatin\nimmunoprecipitation-PCR, respectively. Results Both KD and BHB enhanced GS function under\nnormal and MCAO conditions. BHB reduced cerebral edema and infarct volume post-MCAO.\nNotably, delayed BHB treatment initiated 10 hours post-MCAO still improved GS function, but\ndidn’t influence infarct volume. BHB increased α1-syntrophin expression and H3K27ac levels at\nthe Snta1 enhancer, restoring AQP4 polarization. Besides, BHB also reduced HDAC3 and\nelevated p300 expression. Conclusions These findings suggest that KD and BHB enhance GS\nfunction in mice, with BHB also mitigating brain edema after MCAO. The potentiation of GS\nfunction by BHB is likely mediated by inhibiting HDAC3 and enhancing p300 activity, which\nupregulates α1-syntrophin expression and restores AQP4 polarization.\nKeywords: ischemic stroke, glymphatic system, ketogenic diet, β-hydroxybutyrate, aquaporin-4\npolarization, cerebral edema, epigenetic modulation.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060310320657.pdf"}, {"title": "SP/NK-1R signaling promotes Th17-mediated inflammation after myocardial infarction", "text": "SP/NK-1R signaling promotes Th17-mediated inflammation \nafter myocardial infarction \nMu-Ge QILE1, 2, Shu-Fang HE1, 2* \n1Dept of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui \nMedical University, Hefei 230031, China  \n2Key Laboratory of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine of Anhui Higher Education \nInstitutes, Hefei 230031, China \n*Corresponding author \nEmail: sfhe@ahmu.edu.cn \nAbstract: Objective Sensory neurons can modulate T cell differentiation and immune responses \nvia neuropeptide release.

Here, we examined the distribution and morphology of astrocytes in the\nwhole brain of tree shrews using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)\nimmunofluorescence. GFAP-immunoreactive (-ir) astrocytes were present in the\ntelencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon and myelencephalon of\ntree shrews. Laminar distribution of GFAP-ir astrocytes was observed in the main\nolfactory bulb and hippocampus.

However, the peripheral metabolic alterations induced by sleep loss and\ntheir subsequent restoration during recovery sleep remain insufficiently understood. In\nthis study, we analyzed plasma metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles of 12 healthy\nadults across three conditions: normal sleep, total sleep deprivation, and recovery\nsleep. Comparative analyses revealed widespread metabolic disruptions following\nsleep deprivation. We observed increased levels of tyrosine-derived and related amino\nacid metabolites, along with shifts in compounds associated with gut microbiota, bile\nacids, and specific steroid pathways. In parallel, metabolites involved in purine and\npyrimidine metabolism were markedly decreased. Sleep deprivation also reshaped the\nplasma lipid landscape, characterized by preferential catabolism of long-chain\npolyunsaturated triacylglycerols, leading to the accumulation of proinflammatory\npolyunsaturated free fatty acids. By integrating transcriptomic analysis of peripheral\nblood mononuclear cells, we identified significant disruption in immunometabolic\ncrosstalk. These metabolic and transcript imbalances were only partially corrected\nfollowing recovery sleep, indicating an incomplete restoration of homeostasis.

Understanding the pathways involved in thiamine homeostasis may clarify the connection between this deficiency and neurological disorders like Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. However, the neural mechanisms related to thiamine perception are still not well understood. Our project examines how thiamine deprivation affects feeding behavior in mice and aims to uncover the associated neural mechanisms. We created a thiamine deficiency model by feeding mice a thiamine-deficient diet for three weeks, leading to notable weight loss. To assess their ability to perceive thiamine, we conducted a food preference test allowing mice to choose between thiamine-deficient and thiamine-containing food. The results demonstrated a strong preference for the thiamine-containing food among the thiamine-deprived mice. Additionally, these mice were more attracted to the odor of thiamine-containing food, indicating that olfactory cues are crucial for thiamine perception. We also observed increased c-Fos expression in neurons of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB) after prolonged thiamine deprivation. Notably, activation of these neurons was also found in normally fed mice given a thiamine solution, suggesting that LPB activity is associated with the detection of abnormal thiamine levels. In summary, our findings indicate that mice can detect thiamine through olfaction, and that changes in thiamine levels are reflected in the activity of LPB neurons.

However, the causal role of mitochondrial deficits in driving NDD phenotypes remains poorly understood. We therefore investigated whether postnatal targeting of mitochondrial function could rescue behavioral and cellular abnormalities in Fmr1 knockout (KO) and MIA mouse models of NDD. Methods Fmr1 KO and MIA mouse models received postnatal mitochondria-targeted therapy. Behavioral assessments included open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), social interaction/novelty (SI/SN), novel location test (NLT) and prepulse inhibition (PPI). Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured to analyze mitochondrial morphology (aspect ratio and area) in axon terminals. Results (1) In Fmr1 KO mice, the mitochondria-targeted intervention attenuated anxiety-like hyperactivity in the open field and restored discrimination performance in spatial and social novelty tasks. (2) In MIA offspring, treatment reversed social interaction deficits, and increased center zone exploration in the open field.

Prenatal exposure to \nvalproic acid (VPA) is a significant environmental risk factor linked to ASD . However, the \nunderlying mechanisms remain elusive. Clinical and animal studies have revealed that disruptions \nin brain mRNA translation play a crucial role in ASD pathogenesis, potentially affecting neural \ndevelopment and synaptic function. Never theless, the molecular mechanisms behind translational \nimbalances in the ASD brain are not yet fully understood. In this study, we utilized a prenatal VPA-\nexposed mouse model of ASD to explore the mechanisms underlying mRNA translational \nalterations and to identify potential therapeutic targets for ASD. Using a non-canonical amino acid-\nlabeling method, we measured global protein synthesis levels in the cortex of VPA -exposed mice \nand observed increased de novo protein synthesis . Polysome-based translatomics identified \nupregulation of mitochondrial and ribosomal-related gene sets in the cortex of VPA mice. Western \nblot analysis revealed elevated eIF4E phosphorylation. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of \nMNK during adolescence reversed ASD -like behaviors in VPA mice, suggesting a potential \ntherapeutic strategy for ASD. \n \nKeywords: Autism spectrum disorder; valproic acid ; mRNA translation; translatome; eukaryotic \ninitiation factor 4E \n \nAcknowledgements: This work was supported in part by the STI2030- Major Projects \n(2022ZD0214400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82371175, U24A20804), \nthe International Science and Technology Cooperation Projects of Guangdong Province \n(2023A0505050121), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation \n(2022B1515130007, 2023B1515040015).", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051517014745.pdf"}, {"title": "Sirt1 deficiency leads to autism-like behaviors and hypomyelination in zebrafish", "text": "Sirt1 deficiency leads to autism-like behaviors and hypomyelination in zebrafish\nTing Li1,4, Xiang Chen1,2,4, Shi Qiu1,4, Rong Gao1, Ruixingyuan Xiao1, Qiang Chen1, Xiaoyu Shi3,\nYong Wang1, Cheng He1,*, Peng Liu1,*\n1Institute of Neuroscience, Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology of Ministry of Education,\nNMU, Shanghai 200433, China\n2Department of Clinical Research, The 903rd Hospital, Hangzhou, 310013, China\n3State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology and MOE Frontiers Center for Brain Science,\nInstitutes of Brain Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200030, China\n4These authors contributed equally\n*Correspondence: chenghe@smmu.edu.cn (C.H.), pliu@smmu.edu.cn (P.L.)\nAbstract：Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental\ndisorder characterized by social communication deficits and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors.\nThe NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a key epigenetic regulator involved in\nneurodevelopment and function, shows significantly reduced expression in peripheral blood and\nlymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from ASD patients, with expression levels correlating with\nbehavioral impairment severity.

How environmental risk factors disturb synaptic development and subsequent behavior defects in ASD remains largely unclear. Considering the recent reports that mitochondria-associated amino acid metabolism contributes to ASD development, we attempted to explore the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous product of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism, in the social deficits of environmental factor-induced ASD. Methods: An embryonic double-hit induced ASD mouse model was adopted. Mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed by electron microscope and respiratory Complex activity. H2S and related metabolites were measured by specific fluorescent probes or Mass Spectrum. Expression of synaptic proteins and social functions were evaluated by Western-blots or behavior assays.  Results: We focused on anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and detected mitochondrial dysfunction in the ACC of double-hit mice, accompanied by elevation of H2S levels, and dysregulation of sulfur-containing metabolites. Immunoblot analysis confirmed upregulation of H2S-producing enzymes. Inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory chain induced H2S accumulation and reduced synaptic protein expression. Introducing health mitochondria effectively restored H2S levels and synaptic alterations in double-hit neurons. Lowering H2S in the ACC of double-hit mice significantly ameliorated synaptic disfunction and social deficits . Furthermore, a low-sulfur dietary normalized H2S and rescued social deficits.

Argonaute (AGO) proteins, essential components of the RNA-induced silencing complex, play a pivotal role in post-transcriptional gene regulation through microRNA and small interfering RNA-mediated pathways. In this study, we investigate the role of AGO proteins in neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) through systematic human genetic analysis, in vivo modeling, and cellular functional assays. We characterize 77 de novo missense or nonframeshift variants across AGO1, AGO2, AGO3, and AGO4 from both published and unpublished NDD cohorts, providing compelling evidence that, in addition to AGO1 and AGO2, variants in AGO3 and AGO4 are also associated with NDDs. Using Ago1 G199V knock-in (KI) and Ago1 knock-out (KO) mouse models, we show that both exhibit behavioral and cognitive deficits, particularly autistic-like features, with more severe phenotypes in G199V-KI mice. The G199V mutation disrupts the balance between neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation, impairs neuronal migration, and alters upper-layer cortical lamination. Notably, Ago1 G199V-KI and KO mice exhibit opposing effects on processing body (P-body) and stress granule (SG) dynamics under stress, suggesting distinct mechanisms of RNA granule dysregulation. At the cellular level, AGO1, AGO2, and AGO3 are shown to modulate P-body and SG dynamics, with pathogenic variants disrupting granule function via putative gain- or loss-of-function mechanisms.

Although this characteristic has been widely observed, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. DIP2A is well recognized as an autism-associated gene. We recently found a 10 - year boy with autistic feature carrying heterozygous mutation in the DIP2A gene. To investigate the potential mechanisms, we generated Dip2a mutant mice with cytosine base editor system. Behavioral assays found that male mice exhibited ASD-like phenotypes, including excessive stereotypical repetitive behaviors and impaired sociability, whereas which could not be observed in female mice, indicating that the Dip2a mutation caused sexually dimorphic ASD-like phenotypes in the mice. RNA-seq analysis results indicated that the ‘Transcription Regulator Inhibitor Activity’ significantly enriched. One of the critical downstream target gene (an X-Linked Parent-of-Origin Gene, Xlr3b), usually displayed expression varies between male and female mice, exhibited significantly increased. Furthermore, our results also demonstrated that DIP2A specifically bound and inhibited the Xlr3b expression, which maintained synaptic plasticity by transporting dendritic Camk2a mRNA.

This study aims to investigate the effects of SNX19 overexpression on neural function\nand elucidate its role in SCZ. Methods A Dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to\ndetermine the allelic effects of SCZ-associated SNPs and SNX19 eQTL variants on transcriptional\nactivity. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were performed to investigate the functional\nmechanisms of SNX19 overexpression in the human forebrain organoid (hFO). Neurotransmitter\nrelease assays and multielectrode array recordings were subsequently used to validate the effects\nof SNX19 overexpression on neurotransmitter release and neuronal firing activity in hFOs.\nResults (1) The SCZ-associated SNP rs7106771, as an eQTL for SNX19, exhibits allele-specific\neffects on transcriptional activity. (2) SNX19 overexpression impaired the differentiation of neural\nprogenitor cells and neurons. (3) Increased levels of neurotransmitters, including glutamate and\ngamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), were observed in SNX19-overexpressing hFOs, which was\nassociated with SNX19 binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on precursor synaptic\nvesicles, thereby impairing neurotransmitter vesicle trafficking. (4) Genes dysregulation induced\nby SNX19 overexpression were enriched in multiple neuronal functions, including GABAergic\nsynapse. Moreover, SNX19 overexpression reduced neurotransmitter release and attenuated\nneuronal firing voltage amplification in hFOs.

In this study, utilizing the social defeat stress model, we systematically compare the \neffects of short -term stress during adolescence and adulthood on behavior and cellular levels. \nCombined with the tet-off system to specifically label stress-related engram cells, we indicate that \ncompared to adult stress, adolescent stress results in more dense and excitable engram cells in the \nbasolateral amygdala (BLA), identified as excitatory neurons.

Although interleukin-3 (IL-3) is recognized for its dual roles in\nneuronal survival and immune homeostasis , its involvement in PD pathogenesis remains poorly\ndefined. Here, we demonstrate that IL-3 deficiency attenuates MPTP-induced PD pathology\nthrough modulation of glial-immune networks. In MPTP-treated wild-type mice, IL-3 and its\nreceptor IL-3Rα were markedly upregulated in the nigrostriatal pathway, colocalizing with\nactivated astrocytes and proinflammatory microglia. Strikingly, Il3−/− mice exhibited reduced\ndopaminergic neurodegeneration and improved motor coordination compared to controls.\nProteomic profiling revealed Il3−/− mice exhibited attenuated cGAS–STING signaling, linked to\nexacerbated neuroinflammation and accelerated dopaminergic neurodegeneration. These findings\nhighlight the pivotal role of IL-3 signaling axis in PD-associated neuroimmune dysregulation,\nidentifying IL-3/IL-3Rα as promising therapeutic targets for neuromodulation. Subsequent studies\nwill validate the neuroprotective effects of IL-3 deficiency through AAV-α-Synuclein PD Model,\nwhile systematically investigating the functional duality of IL-3/IL-3Rα signaling in disease\nprogression via IL-3Rα knockout, pharmacological inhibition, and agonist approaches.

This study aimed to investigate\nwhether EA exerts analgesic effects by downregulates matrix metalloproteinase 19 (MMP19) in\nthe dorsal root ganglion (DRG) to modulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) and inhibit satellite\nglial cell (SGC) activation. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish a\nchronic constriction injury (CCI) model. Beginning on day 8 after CCI surgery, rats received daily\n30-minute EA sessions for 7 consecutive days. Pain behavioral tests were performed on rats in\neach group. Transcriptomic sequencing was conducted on the affected DRG of rats. Candidate\ndifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were further validated using quantitative real-time\npolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot (WB). The activation status of satellite glial\ncells (SGCs) was assessed via immunofluorescence. Results: (1) Compared with the sham group,\nthe mechanical pain threshold of CCI model rats was significantly decreased; compared with the\nCCI group, the mechanical pain threshold of EA-treated rats was significantly increased. (2)\nTranscriptomic sequencing analysis revealed the ECM signaling pathway is significantly enriched\nand identified ECM-related DEGs including Mmp19, Adamts4, Col5a3, and Col15a1. (3) WB\nresults showed that compared with the sham group, the expression of MMP19 in the DRG of CCI\ngroup was significantly upregulated; compared with the CCI group, MMP19 expression in the\nDRG of EA group was significantly downregulated. (4) qPCR results showed that compared with\nthe sham group, the mRNA level of Mmp19 and Adamts4 in the DRG of CCI group was\nsignificantly upregulated; compared with the CCI group, the mRNA level of Mmp19 and Adamts4\nin the DRG of EA group was significantly downregulated. (5) Immunofluorescence revealed that，\ncompared with the sham group, GFAP-labeled SGCs in the DRG of CCI group exhibited\nsignificant activation ; compared with the CCI group, GFAP fluorescence intensity in the DRG of\nEA group was significantly reduced, and the number of activated SGCs in the DRG of EA group\nwas significantly decreased.

While NRSF/REST (neuron‑restrictive silencer factor/repressor element‑1 silencing \ntranscription factor) is known to regulate numerous inflammatory genes and pathways in neurons, \nits role in microglia remains unexplored. To address this, we generated TMEM119\nCreERT:NRSFflox/flox \nconditional knockout (cKO) mice, using tamoxifen to selectively delete NRSF/REST in microglia. \nPD-like injury was induced by a subacute MPTP regimen, and nigrostriatal integrity was assessed \nin wild‑type (WT) and cKO animals. \nCompared to WT controls, cKO mice exhibited markedly greater microglial and astrocytic \nactivation and more severe dopaminergic neurodegeneration after MPTP exposure. Inflammatory \nmarkers CD11b and TNF‑ α were significantly upregulated in cKO brains, whereas  the \nanti‑inflammatory cytokine IL‑4 was reduced. Notably, cKO mice also showed a pronounced \ndecline in striatal dopamine content, indicating that microglial NRSF/REST deficiency impairs \ndopamine synthesis. \nThese findings reveal that NRSF/REST in microglia exerts a protective role in PD by modulating \nglial activation and sustaining dopaminergic function. Loss of microglial NRSF/REST exacerbates \nneuroinflammation and α‐ synuclein–associated neurodegeneration, i dentifying this pathway as a \npotential therapeutic target. \n \nKeywords: Parkinson‘s disease，NRSF/REST，micoglia", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051521343739.pdf"}, {"title": "Neurovascular Mechanisms of Acidification in Ischemic Stroke", "text": "Brain Acidosis as a Biomarker for Ischemic Penumbra\nEvolution\nYun-Wen Yang1, Yu-Wen Sun1, Jian-Fei Lu1,*, Tian-Le Xu1,*\n1Department of Anatomy and Physiology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine,\nShanghai, China\n*Corresponding author\nAbstract:\nAcidosis is a common pathological feature following ischemic stroke and may play a critical role\nin neurovascular unit dysfunction.

RNA\nsequencing, ELISA, and inhibitors were used to explore the role of TGF-β, a downstream\nmolecule of MyD88 signaling in MG activation. Results (1) MyD88 increased significantly in\nMG post-SCI, remaining elevated while MG failed to return to homeostasis from subacute (7d) to\nchronic (28d) phases. (2) Inhibiting MyD88 skewed MG towards an anti-inflammatory (M2) state\nin vitro and in vivo. However, broad spinal MyD88 inhibition (ST2825) suppressed scar formation\nand impaired hindlimb locomotor recovery. (3) In contrast, MyD88 CKO mice showed reduced\nMG overactivation acutely, enabling MG homeostasis restoration from subacute to chronic phases.\nThis MG-specific MyD88 deletion increased neurotrophic factor secretion (e.g., GAP43,\nfibronectin), decreased glial scarring, promoted CST reconnection and synaptic remodeling, and\nsignificantly improved motor function. (4) RNAseq implicated TGF-β signaling enrichment in\nMyD88 CKO mice. Orally inhibiting TGF-β (LY2109761) in MyD88 CKO mice reactivated\nperi-lesion MG and worsened functional deficits. Conclusion The MyD88 signaling pathway in\nMG critically regulates MG activation status post-SCI, influencing chronic-phase glial scar\nformation, CST repair, and synaptic reconstruction. Precisely regulating MG MyD88 signaling\nrepresents a promising acute-phase therapeutic target for SCI.\nKeywords: MyD88 signal; microglia activation; TGF-β; spinal cord injury; loco-motor function", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060610311146.pdf"}, {"title": "Distinct olfactory bulb-cortex neural circuits coordinate cognitive function in Parkinson Disease", "text": "Distinct olfactory bulb-cortex neural circuits coordinate \ncognitive function in Parkinson Disease \nXing-Feng Mao1, Shuai-Shuai Wang2, Ying-Mei Lu1*, Feng Han2* \n1Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing \n211166, China.  \n2Medical Basic Research Innovation Center for Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases, \nMinistry of Education, China; International Joint Laboratory for Drug Target of Critical Illnesses, \nSchool of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.  \n*Corresponding author \nE-mail: fenghan169@njmu.edu.cn \nAbstract：Objective Cognitive dysfunction stands as a prevalent and consequential non- motor \nmanifestation in Parkinson's Disease (PD).

These \nlimitations underscore the need for safer, more targeted A β-modulating therapies. Given the \nselective inhibitory effect of transient receptor potential cat ion channel subfamily V member 4  \n(TRPV4) on Aβ generation, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of its functional transmembrane \npeptide domain(TM), delivered via circular RNA (circRNA) in different stages of 5xFAD mice. \nMethods: In vitro, TRPV4-TM was overexpressed in HEK293-APP cells using both plasmid and \ncircRNA vectors to evaluate its effect on A β production.

Gut-derived dopamine (DA) exerts potent effects in the gut where it influences epithelial cell homeostasis. We recently found that selective knockout of dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1) in intestinal epithelial cells of a mouse model of PD led to an improvement in motor symptoms and promoted intestinal proliferation. However, the upstream regulators of intestinal Drd1 signaling and their contributions to intestinal epithelial proliferation and PD pathogenesis remain largely unknown. This study aims to identify gut-derived metabolites and small-molecule compounds that modulate Drd1 activity, thereby providing new insights into the gut-originated hypothesis of PD and laying the groundwork for therapeutics development for PD. Methods We screened a gut-derived metabolite library using a luciferase-based cAMP response assay to identify compounds that modulating Drd1 signaling pathways. We performed antagonist screening of compounds derived from traditional Chinese medicine using PRESTO-Tango assay combined with a cAMP response assay and murine intestinal organoids. Results (1) Six metabolites among 122 metabolites were found to increase levels of cAMP and PKA phosphorylation. (2) Four compounds exhibited antagonistic effects by suppressing G-protein-dependent Drd1 signaling. (3) Either knockout of Ppp1r1b, a downstream target of Drd1, or treatment with Drd1 antagonists increased EdU+ cell proportions and promoted intestinal organoid growth. Conclusion Drd1 signaling regulates intestinal epithelial proliferation. Gut-derived metabolites may act as previously uncharted modulators of this process through agonistic interactions with Drd1. This study suggest intestinal Drd1-inactivation as a novel strategy for precise intervention in PD.

UPR is a signal transduction network which maintains ER homeostasis. While the \nregulation of ER stress has become one of the main research topics in various neurological diseases, \nthe details of the mechanisms by which ER stress is involved in brain damage remain unclear. In our \nprevious study, we reported that one of the major cell types involved in UPR activation after brain \ninjury was vascular endothelial cells, based on the analysis of brain injury model using ER stress \nreporter mice. Therefore, in this study, we aim to elucidate the role of UPR in vascular endothelial \ncells, in the process of  recovery following brain injury.We generated vascular endothelial  cell-\nspecific conditional knockout mice of IRE1, a key UPR sensor, and the mice were subjected to motor \ncortex injury , a  mouse model of TBI . Behavioral assessments of motor function showed that \nendothelial cell- specific deletion of IRE1 significantly impaired motor function recovery after brain \ninjury. Immunohistochemical analysis further revealed that conditional knockout of endothelial \nIRE1 exacerbated the accumulation of CD45 -positive immune cells and the breakdown of blood-\nbrain barrier  (BBB), indicated by the leakage of serum protein and the reduced expression of \nadhesion molecule, following brain injury .

The hippocampus, a brain region closely connected to the  \namygdala, plays a key role in the pathological processes of PTSD. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) \nmethylation of RNAs in the hippocampus is known to play a significant role in regulating the brain’s \nresponse to stress and emotional disorders. Method This study aimed to comprehensively analyze \nthe roles of transcriptome-wide m6A modifications of the hippocampus in the BLA DBS treatment \nof a PTSD mouse model using m 6A sequencing.  Results Significant alterations in functional \nconnectivity between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and BLA were observed in foot shock (FS) \nmice through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. Furthermore, we observed \nthat the expression of the key m 6A methyltransferase enzyme, METTL3, in the FS and BLA DBS \ngroups was higher than that in the control group. At the same time, both FS and BLA DBS induced \nthe widespread m6A methylation of RNAs in the vHPC. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis \nrevealed that FS altered methylation in metabolic, developmental, and cytoskeletal pathways, while \nBLA DBS targeted metabolic, cell cycle, and neuroplasticity-related genes. Additionally, BLA DBS \nreversed the aberrant methylation of genes associated with multiple functional pathways induced by \nFS, including those related to cholinergic transmission, sodium and calcium ion homeostasis, and \nstress hormone responsiveness. We identified a set of RNAs with methylation changes that were \nreversed by BLA DBS in the FS vs. Ctrl (control) comparison, including those associated wi th \ncholinergic transmission, sodium and calcium ion balance, and stress hormone response. \nAdditionally, we detected several specific BLA DBS -related genes through MeRIP -qPCR, \nindicating that DBS influences crucial genes linked to calcium signaling and syna ptic plasticity. \nConclusions We draw two conclusions from these findings: BLA DBS may alleviate PTSD -like \nsymptoms by reversing FS-induced methylation changes and by altering the methylation levels of \ncrucial genes.

Metabolic\ndysregulation, particularly metabolic syndrome induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), is a shared risk\nfactor for both AD and VD. This study aims to investigate whether and how metabolic\ndysregulation exacerbates cognitive impairment and pathological progression in MixD mice.\nMethods Model Establishment: 1) MixD animal models were generated by performing bilateral\ncommon carotid artery stenosis surgery in 4-month-old 3xTg AD transgenic mice; 2) Metabolic\ninjury was induced via a 4-month HFD regimen; 3) Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was\nsimulated via intraperitoneal streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Female and male mice were\nrandomly assigned to five groups: ① AD + normal diet (ND); ② AD + HFD; ③ MixD + ND; ④\nMixD + HFD; ⑤ MixD + T2DM. Measurements: 1) Cognitive function was assessed using the\nMorris water maze; 2) Serum lipid profiles were analyzed via ELISA; 3) AD pathological markers\n(p-Tau, Aβ) were quantified using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry. 4) Synaptic\nintegrity was evaluated via silver staining, transmission electron microscopy, and synaptic protein\ndetection by Western blot; 5) Hepatic and cerebral KLF14 protein levels were measured via\nWestern blot; 6) KLF14 downstream targets were predicted using the JASPAR database and\nvalidated via EMSA and ChIP assays; 7) Methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was performed to\nassess hepatic KLF14 methylation levels.\nResults Female MixD mice exhibited greater susceptibility to metabolic injury, manifesting as\nsignificant cognitive decline, reduced APOA-I expression, and increased p-Tau and Aβ burden and\nsynaptic damage in the brain. Western blot revealed that metabolic dysregulation selectively\nreduced hepatic KLF14 in female MixD mice, with no effect in males. Liver-specific KLF14\noverexpression via adenoviral delivery ameliorated cognitive deficits, p-Tau and Aβ pathology,\nand synaptic dysfunction in HFD-fed female MixD mice. Mechanistically, KLF14\ntranscriptionally regulated APOA-I, and intravenous recombinant APOA-I administration\nreplicated the protective effects. MS-PCR demonstrated that metabolic injury induced\nhypermethylation of hepatic KLF14 in females, which was reversed by the DNA methylation\ninhibitor 5-Aza, leading to significant pathological improvement.\nConclusion Metabolic dysregulation exacerbates cognitive impairment and pathological burden in\nfemale MixD mice by suppressing hepatic KLF14 expression. This sex-specific effect may\ninvolve KLF14 hypermethylation and its regulatory role in APOA-I expression.

Synaptic structural disruption may \nexacerbate excitatory stress, and microglia actively contribute to synaptic remodeling and \nregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance. Riluzole, the only FDA-approved drug targeting \nglutamate metabolism in ALS, offers limited survival benefit. Whether riluzole efficacy is \ninfluenced by excitatory shifts during disease progression remains unclear. This study aims to \ninvestigate how cortical excitatory alterations impact riluzole responsiveness and to explore the \nrole of microglia in modulating E/I homeostasis over the course of ALS. Methods A stage-specific \nALS mouse model was used to assess motor behavior alongside immunofluorescence analyses \ntargeting glutamatergic neurotransmitters, synaptic structures, and microglial morphology in the \nmotor cortex. Mice were evaluated at early, middle, and late disease stages, comparing riluzole-\ntreated and untreated groups. Results Progressive motor deficits were observed from the middle \nstage onward. Riluzole treatment altered glutamatergic neurotransmitter levels during the middle \nand late stages but did not significantly improve synaptic structural integrity. Microglial activation \nand morphological changes occurred early, preceding motor symptoms, and riluzole modulated \nthese changes primarily at later stages. Conclusion Microglial alterations precede overt motor \ndysfunction in ALS and may underlie excitatory imbalance. Riluzole exerts stage-dependent \neffects on glutamatergic signaling and microglial morphology but shows limited impact on \nsynaptic structure. These findings suggest that therapeutic outcomes may depend on the timing of \nintervention relative to excitatory and glial changes, highlighting the need for stage-specific \nstrategies targeting neuron–glia interactions. \nKeywords: ALS; excitotoxicity; riluzole; microglia; excitatory-inhibitory balance; synapse; motor \ncortex", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051419453444.pdf"}, {"title": "P301S Mutant Tau-Driven Zebrafish Platform Enables Systematic Identification of Pharmacological GSK3β Inhibitors with Anti-Neurodegenerative Efficacy", "text": "P301S Mutant Tau-Driven Zebrafish Platform Enables Systematic Identification of\nPharmacological GSK3β Inhibitors with Anti-Neurodegenerative Efficacy\nJuanjuan Luo1, Chunjiao Lu1,4, Wenjie Xie1,3, Xing Zhu1, Zezhong Ren1, Juntao Chen1,3,\nSishi Fu1, Xin Meng1, Yan Zeng1, Xiaoling Shi1, Zhou Fang1, Juanjuan Luo1,* and\nXiaojun Yang2,*\nAbstract\nOur aging society is confronted with a dramatic increase of patients suffering from\ntauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. These\ndiseases are characterized by typical neuropathological lesions, such as\nhyperphosphorylation of tau protein, subsequent aggregation, neurofibrillary tangle\nformation, and neuronal cell death. Currently, there is no effective therapeutic\nstrategy to prevent or reverse the progression of these diseases. Here, we\nsuccessfully established a Tau-P301S transgenic zebrafish model, wherein we used\nthe zebrafish neuron-specific promoter huc to drive the expression of human TAU\nP301S mutant protein, which was labeled with eGFP green fluorescent protein. This\nmodel recapitulated the key pathological features of tauopathy during early\ndevelopment, including phosphorylation and conformational changes of human tau\nprotein, neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuronal dysfunction, behavioral\nabnormalities, and cell death, thereby presenting a phenotype closely resembling\nthat of human tauopathy patients. Due to their optical transparency and small size,\nzebrafish larvae are highly suitable for in vivo imaging and drug screening. Therefore,\nwe performed high-throughput screening of tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β\n(GSK3β) by integrating computer molecular docking with zebrafish models, leading to\nthe identification of a novel and highly potent GSK3β inhibitor, CDK4/6-IN-2.

The pathological mechanisms of C9-ALS/FTD are complex, including at least three directions: (1) loss-of-function of C9orf72 gene; (2) HRE RNA toxicity; and (3) dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) toxicity caused by repeat-associated non-AUG translation (RAN). Cytoplasmic aggregation and mislocalization of the nuclear proteins and nuclear transport defects have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. Despite these observations, the detailed processes contributing to the disease are not fully understood. Existing therapies show only modest efficacy in delaying motor function deterioration and limited effectiveness in early stages of the disease, highlighting an urgent need for new therapeutic discoveries. Our previous studies have identified the robust neuroprotective effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), the NAD+ synthesis enzyme. NMNAT maintains neuronal structural and functional integrity and protects against injury-, excitotoxicity- and proteinopathy-induced degeneration through dual functions in NAD+ metabolism and in protein homeostasis. Recently, we gathered exciting preliminary data of the NMNAT isoform-specific neuroprotection against DPR-induced neurotoxicity. Here we demonstrate that nuclear NMNAT expression is protective against DPR-induced neurotoxicity. We show that co-expression with a nuclear NMNAT isoform suppresses DPR-induced morphological and functional neurodegeneration. These findings reveal an interplay between DPRs and NMNAT that provides insights on ALS/FTD pathophysiology and developing targeted therapeutic interventions.

Based on the theory of traditional Chinese\nmedicine, this study constructed a mouse model of PD with kidney essence deficiency syndrome\nto explore the mechanism of mitophagy mediated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway.

Based on residual consciousness levels, patients\nare categorized into vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS), with the latter\nhaving a higher potential for recovery and better prognostic outcomes. However, current\ndiagnostic practices, which primarily rely on behavioral scales, are associated with a misdiagnosis\nrate of up to around 40%. This study aims to develop an interpretable, multimodal machine\nlearning model to accurately assess the consciousness levels in DoC patients. Methods A\nprospective cohort study was conducted on 583 patients with DoC from our institutional database\nbetween January 2018 and January 2023.

In\nclinical practice, deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting CM-pf has considerable potential\nadvantages in the treatment of patients with disorder of consciousness (DOC), and the most\neffective stimulation frequency is 100Hz. However, the dynamic process of CM-pf DBS\nregulation of cortical-brain network and its characteristic dimension representation are still\nunknown. Methods In this study, we recruited 7 patients with DOC. We designed a repeat\nexperiment to collect EEG data 30 minutes before, during and after stimulation. To explore the\nmarkers of DBS improving consciousness, we adopted the orthogonal projective NMF (OPNMF)\nalgorithm to analyze the different internal state components (i.e., functional subnetwork) of\ndynamic brain network activity in different EEG frequency bands. In addition, based on the study\nof the internal states of dynamic brain networks, we explore whether changes in cortical gradients\ninduced by DBS in a specific frequency band with a DBS modulation response can indicate\nchanges in consciousness. Results In the significantly effective group, DBS caused the activation\nof functional connectivity in all frequency bands of patients, while the functional connectivity in\nthe gamma band was only changed in patients with increased consciousness but no significant\nimprovement. Both the significant effective group and the effective group had significant DBS\nregulation in the State-A and State-D states of the Gamma-band. In gamma-band, internal State-D\nas a sparse but functionally connected internal state mode, there are three main functional\nconnection excitation regions, FCN_pCun, DMN_Pa and VN. Besides, we speculate that the\nenhanced functional differentiation between the visual/limbic network and the multi-functional\nbrain network region gradients may correspond to improvements in functions such as sensory\norganization and attention, which may be related to psychoactive effects. Conclusion This study\nshowed that CM-pf DBS predicted the improvement of consciousness level by adjusting the\nspatiotemporal features of the dynamic brain network. Furthermore, the gamma frequency band\ncan reflect the improvement of consciousness regulated by CM-pf DBS.\nKeywords: Deep brain stimulation, disorder of consciousness, internal brain states, functional\nconnectivity network, cortical gradient", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060616402954.pdf"}, {"title": "Early Warning of Postoperative Delirium via a Neural Biomarker Extracted from Intraoperative EEG", "text": "Early Warning of Postoperative Delirium via a Neural\nBiomarker Extracted from Intraoperative EEG\nYan ZHU1, Yinuo ZHANG1, Xinxin ZHANG2, Xinke SHEN1, Zhichao LIANG1,*, Quanying\nLIU1,*, Guangchao ZHAO2,*\n1Neural Computing & Control lab, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of\nScience and Technology\n2Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military\nMedical University\n*Corresponding author\nEmail: 12212557@mail.sustech.edu.cn\nAbstract: Objective: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common yet underdiagnosed\nneurocognitive disorder in elderly surgical patients. Current diagnostic tools heavily rely on\nsubjective assessments with low sensitivity and poor generalizability. The objective of this study is\nto develop an objective, interpretable, and accurate early warning method for POD, based on\nintraoperative EEG recordings. Method: We develop a spatio-temporal convolutional network\n(ST-CN) framework to model intraoperative EEG dynamics. The model leverages cascaded spatial\nand temporal convolutional layers to automatically learn multiscale features from raw 32-channel\nEEG signals, avoiding predefined frequency bands or manual feature engineering. The system was\ntrained and evaluated on data collected from 71 non-cardiac surgery patients under general\nanesthesia. Results: The proposed ST-CN model achieved a classification accuracy of 97.52% in\ndistinguishing POD from non-POD patients. Importantly, the model identified a novel\nelectrophysiological biomarker: abnormal θ/α cross-frequency coupling superimposed on\nspindle-like waveforms, significantly enriched in patients who developed POD.

Our study has reported that the low -intensity focused ultrasound stimulation (LIFUS) \nreversed social avoidance by enhancing neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) . \nPrevious studies showed that LIFUS activated astrocytic TRPA1 to mediate neural activities in vitro \nand that the interaction of astrocytes and neurons  modulated neuropsychiatric disorders . We \nhypothesized that astrocytic TRPA1 by LIFUS modulated the astrocyte-neuron excitation to improve \nsocial avoidance. Methods Repeated social defeat  stress (SDS) was applied to induce avoidance \nbehavior. The chronic LIFUS  targeted the prelimbic (PrL) area of mPFC  region.

Results We found that \nastrocyte activity in PrL was enhanced instantaneously during LIFUS, whereas TRPA1 knocking-\ndown mice exhibited less response, and that in social behavior after LIFUS presented the same trend \namong groups. Meanwhile, the activity of PrL excitatory neurons in SDS mice was enhanced during \nsocial interaction with novel aggressive mice after chronic LIFUS, which was related to their \neffectively alleviated social avoidance.

The purpose of this article is to explore whether more precise intervention can be carried\nout by combining loop intervention and multichannel transcranial electrical stimulation to\ndynamically optimize the stimulation program.

Despite their remarkable utility, these green sensors are constrained by spectral\noverlap with other green-fluorescent signaling molecule indicators and blue/cyan light-activated\noptogenetic tools, limiting their compatibility in multiplexed imaging applications. Existing red\ncAMP sensors, though spectrally compatible, suffer from a narrow dynamic range (<1.5-fold in\nHEK293T cells), low cellular brightness, aggregation, or significant blue-light-induced\nphotoactivation. Here, we report the development of R-Flamp1, a new red cAMP sensor with an\nexceptional dynamic range (>10-fold in HEK293T cells), enhanced brightness, appropriate\ncAMP affinity, sub-second response kinetics, and minimal photoactivation under blue/cyan light\nexposure. We demonstrate that R-Flamp1 enables sensitive detection of both optogenetically\nevoked and behaviorally relevant cAMP dynamics, as well as simultaneous monitoring of cAMP\nand other neuromodulators or neuronal activity in Drosophila and mouse neurons.

While thresholding is routinely applied\nto construct brain network, it is unclear whether the brain’s large-scale connectivity is inherently\nsparse or densely populated with weak but meaningful connections. This study systematically\nevaluates the sparsity of brain networks across multiple modalities and parcellation schemes.\nMethods Using DTI and fMRI data from Human Connectome Project (HCP) and multiple brain\natlases, we constructed individual-level whole-brain structural (SC), functional (FC), and effective\nconnectivity (EC) matrices. At the group level, we statistically assessed the presence of each\nconnection (i.e., whether each connection significantly deviated from zero). We further compared\nLASSO and Ridge regression by predicting future resting-state fMRI dynamics and recovering the\nunderlying FC from the predicted fMRI, in order to evaluate the assumption about network\nsparsity. Finally, we examined the impact of removing weak connections on key network\nproperties, including modularity, robustness, and hub-node architecture. Results Across all\nmodalities and parcellations, the majority of connections were statistically significant, despite\nmany having weak magnitude. Ridge regression, which assumes dense priors, consistently\noutperformed LASSO in dynamics prediction and FC reconstruction, indicating that macroscopic\nbrain connectivity is better captured by smooth, distributed, weak weights (i.e., connections).\nPruning these weak connections increase network modularity, reduced resilience to perturbations,\nand distorted hub profiles, highlighting their functional relevance.

A common scenario in spatial navigation is goal-directed navigation, \ne.g. homing behavior. While substantial amount of studies have been conducted in this field, the \nmechanism of goal-directed navigation remains underexplored. Recent experimental and \ntheoretical works (Pires et al., 2024, Zuo et al., 2024) have demonstrated the mechanism of \nDrosophila performing goal-directed behavior of heading orientation with gradient of similarity \nbetween heading and goal representations over direction, which will suffer from gradient \nvanishing in a broader environment. In the present work, we propose that a grid-like \nrepresentation can help solving the problem of gradient vanishing. To demonstrate that, we build a \nmulti-module model consisting of three major parts: place cells (PCs), grid cells (GCs) and \nheading direction cells (HDCs). PCs are modeled as a 2-dimensional continuous attractor neural \nnetwork (CANN), which holds a representation of spatial location as a bump-shaped neural \nresponse. GCs are modeled as multiple independent CANNs reciprocally connected with the place \ncell module in different periodic spaces, resulting in different periods over space. Our simulation \ndemonstrated that the periodicity of grid cell guarantees the existence of the gradient all over the \nspace, addressing the gradient vanishing problem. HDCs are simulated as a 1-dimensional ring \nattractor network. We proved that the movement of spatial representation in 2D CANN can be \nperfectly controlled by orthogonal components, which are respectively modulated by HDCs \nthrough cosine-shaped connection weights.

This study investigates the\nmolecular mechanisms underlying PS-induced depression-like behaviors in rat offspring, focusing\non the galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) in the ventral hippocampus. Behavioral assessments revealed\nthat male offspring exposed to PS exhibited hallmark symptoms of depression, including\nanhedonia, behavioral despair, and increased anxiety-like behavior. Molecular analyses showed a\nmarked downregulation of GALR2 mRNA and protein expression in the ventral hippocampus, but\nnot in the medial prefrontal cortex. This reduction was strongly correlated with the severity of\ndepressive behaviors and was linked to increased DNA methylation at the GALR2 promoter. The\nelevated methylation was associated with enhanced activity and promoter binding of DNA\nmethyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3b.

Peripheral neurons can still regenerate, but at a slow rate (1-2 mm/day), making it challenging to achieve significant functional recovery in patients, as a much longer-distance axon regeneration is required compared to rodents. More pessimistically, neuronal regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) is virtually non-existent due to poor intrinsic regenerative capacity and the presence of growth-inhibitory factors, resulting in irreversible damage and permanent functional deficits for patients. Sequencing technologies have identified regeneration-associated genes (RAGs, e.g., PTEN, SOCS3) that play crucial roles in axon regeneration. Among these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after nerve injury, we identified two differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs) in L4/5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that critically regulate axon regeneration, through integrated analysis of published RNA-seq/microarray datasets from sciatic nerve injury models. siRNA-mediated silencing of these DElncRNAs in DRG neurons reduced axonal regrowth in sciatic nerve crush (SNC) models. Conversely, AAV-driven overexpression of DElncRNA accelerated the axon regeneration rate and restored sensory/motor function after SNC injury. Strikingly, these DElncRNAs also promoted axon regeneration and neuronal survival in optic nerve injury models, one of the CNS injury models. Our findings demonstrate that lncRNAs serve as master regulators bridging PNS/CNS repair, providing novel therapeutic targets for nerve injury treatment.

In the brain, ferroptosis has been linked to cell death in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. However, it is unknown whether it plays a role in normal brain physiology via the programmed elimination of neural precursor cells (NPCs) during adult neurogenesis. Here, we examined whether inducing or inhibiting ferroptosis could alter adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and consequently impact cognitive function. Methods In order to measure the influence of ferroptosis ex vivo, we isolated NPCs from the dentate gyrus (DG) area of the hippocampus and applied several different ferroptosis inducers and inhibitors. Next, we assessed the proliferation capacity of these NPCs using the neurosphere assay. To induce ferroptosis in vivo, we used transgenic GPX4NPCKO mice, in which a ferroptosis-inhibiting selenoprotein GPX4 is selectively deleted in NPCs. To inhibit ferroptosis in aged brains, we delivered Liproxstatin-1, a potent ferroptosis inhibitor, to aged C57BL/6J mice. We then quantified the levels of NPC proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. A set of behavioral tests was also used to assess cognitive function. Results We found that ferroptosis inducers can decrease the proliferation capacity of NPCs from the DG area, while ferroptosis inhibitors increase this capacity ex vivo. Furthermore, enhancing ferroptosis significantly decreased the number of NPCs in GPX4NPCKO mice, and the change in neurogenesis level was associated with impaired hippocampus-related cognitive ability. Conversely, blocking ferroptosis significantly restored the cognitive decline in C57BL/6J mice induced by aging. Conclusion Together, our results reveal a physiological role for ferroptosis in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis and associated spatial learning and memory function.

We generated a cell-type\nresolved atlas of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in the developing macaque\nand mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). Comparing with published human data, our\nﬁndings demonstrate that although the cortex cellular composition is overall\nconserved across species, progenitor cells show signiﬁcant evolutionary divergence in\ncellular properties. Speciﬁcally, human neural progenitors exhibit extensive\ntranscriptional rewiring in growth factor and extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways.\nExpression of the human-speciﬁc progenitor marker ITGA2 in the fetal mouse cortex\nincreases the progenitor proliferation and the proportion of upper-layer neurons.\nThese transcriptional divergences are primarily driven by altered activity in the distal\nregulatory elements. The chromatin regions with human-gained accessibility are\nenriched with human-speciﬁc sequence changes and polymorphisms linked to\nintelligence and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our results identify evolutionary changes\nin neural progenitors and putative gene regulatory mechanisms shaping primate brain\nevolution.\nKeywords:muti-omics, neural progenitor, evolution, primate brain", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060314371195.pdf"}, {"title": "Enhancing glymphatic fluid transport by activation of the angiotensin II type-2 receptor alleviates traumatic brain injury", "text": "Enhancing glymphatic fluid transport by activation of the angiotensin II type-2\nreceptor alleviates traumatic brain injury\nXiaoyu Zhang1,2 , Haifeng Wang 1,2*\n1 Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun,\n130041, China\n2Jilin Provincial Clinical Research Center for Central Nervous System Injury and\nRepair, Changchun, 130021, China\n*Corresponding author\nE-mail: hfwang@mails.jlu.edu.cn\nAbstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) disrupts the glymphatic system, impairing metabolic\nwaste clearance and promoting neurodegeneration.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS), also known as insulin resistance syndrome, is \ncharacterized by obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. MetS has been reported to be \nassociated with surgical complications. However, the association between PIS and MetS remains \nunclear.  \nMethods: We conducted a case -control study by selecting 139,191 participants with complete \nmetabolic parameters from 223,415 non-cardiac surgery patients at the Chinese People’s Liberation \nArmy General Hospital between January 2008 and August 2019. Univariate and multivariate \nlogistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association of MetS and PIS, adjusting \nfor perioperative parameters. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment \nweighting (IPTW) were applied to address the potential confounding effects of covariates. Subgroup \nand sensitivity analyses were performed to verify the robustness of the association between MetS \nand PIS.    \nResults: Among 139,191 participants, 328 (0.24%) developed PIS. Participants with MetS had a \n2.18-fold increased risk of PIS. Glucose and blood pressure were identified as important parameters \nin MetS; each 1 mmol/L increase in glucose concentration was associated with an 11% increase in \nthe odds of PIS (OR = 1.11), and each 1 mmHg increase in blood pressure was associated with \nnearly a 1% increase in odds (OR = 1.02). In the PSM and IPTW models, the odd ratios for MetS \nwere 1.41 and 1.35, respectively. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, coronary heart disease  \n(CHD), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, low -density lipoprotein \ncholesterol (LDL-C) and duration of procedures showed that the association between MetS and PIS \nremained significant (p < 0.05). In sensitivity analyses, the results remained robust after excluding \npatients on specific medications and those with a prognostic nutrition index (PNI) less than 38.8.   \nConclusions: This study is the first to identify MetS as an independent risk factor for PIS among \nnon-cardiac surgical patients in China. Abnormal parameters in MetS, especially elevated glucose \nlevels and elevated blood pressure, significantly increase the risk of PIS.

Our prior work demonstrated that\nicariin (ICA) mitigates cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination by suppressing oxidative stress\nand neuroinflammation. It is notable that in the CPZ model, the number of astrocytes (AST) in the\ncorpus callosum region increased significantly, suggesting that they may be involved in the\ndynamic regulation of myelin injury and repair. This study combines the CPZ mouse model and\nthe primary AST culture system, aiming to reveal the mechanism by which ICA inhibits\ndemyelination by regulating AST polarization (A1/A2 transformation), and provide new ideas for\nthe treatment of demyelia-related diseases.Methods Twenty-four male C57BL/6 mice were\nrandomly divided into the CON group, the CPZ group and the ICA treatment group, with 8 mice\nin each group. Myelin integrity was evaluated by True-Gold staining. The levels of type A1 AST\nmarker C3 and its derivative factors CXCL10 and CXCL1, as well as the levels of type A2 AST\nmarker S100A10 and its derivative factors fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and ciliary\nneurotrophic factor (CNTF) were detected by immunofluorescence staining. The expression of\nS100A10 was detected by Western Blot. The levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1α) and\nneurotrophic factor (BDNF) were detected by ELISA. The primary AST was divided into the\nCON group, the CYK group and the ICA intervention group. The expressions of C3, S100A10,\nCXCL10 and FGF2 were detected by immunofluorescence staining, and the expressions of\nCXCL1, CXCL10, FGF2 and BDNF were detected by ELISA. Results Myelin in the corpus\ncallosum of mice in the CPZ group was significantly lost, the expressions of A1/A2 type AST\nmarkers and derivative factors increased. After ICA treatment, demyelination was significantly\nalleviated, the expressions of C3, CXCL10, CXCL1, FGF2, TNF-α, and IL-1α were significantly\\ndecreased, while S100A10, CNTF, and BDNF remained at high levels.

Recent studies\nhave identified KCNH7 mutations in patients with bipolar spectrum disorders family, implicating that KCNH7 play a\ncritical role in BD pathogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Methods 4-7-month-old\nKcnh7 systemic knockdown (Kcnh7+/-) mice and age-matched wild-type (Kcnh7+/+) mice were used in this study. First, the\nexpression levels of synapse-related proteins in the hippocampus were assessed via Western blotting. The dendritic spine\ndensity and morphology were analyzed using sparse labeling combined with confocal microscopy. Next, total RNA was\nextracted from the hippocampal tissue of Kcnh7+/+ and Kcnh7+/- mice for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis,\nrespectively, followed by qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes. Finally, mice with hippocampus-specific\nknockdown of Kcnh7 in excitatory neurons was generated, and their emotional and social behavioral changes were\nexamined. Results Compared to the Kcnh7+/+ mice, there is a significantly increase in the total number of dendritic spines in\nthe hippocampal CA1 region of Kcnh7+/- mice. Meanwhile, the expression levels of GluR1, GluR2, and NR2A were\nsignificantly upregulated in hippocampal CA1 region of Kcnh7+/- mice. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that the\nupregulated genes in the hippocampus of Kcnh7+/- mice were enriched in synaptic structure- and function-related pathways,\nwhich suggested that Kcnh7 knockdown alters synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, mice with hippocampus-specific\nknockdown of Kcnh7 in excitatory neurons exhibited cognitive impairment in novel object recognition tests, suggesting that\nhippocampal KCNH7 deficiency may directly contribute to cognitive dysfunction.

While hypothalamic circuits are well -established regulators of \nmaternal behavior, the contribution of cortical neurons, particularly those in the anterior \ncingulate cortex (ACC), to MCI pathogenesis remains poorly understood . This study \naimed to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying NMS -induced MCI, focusing \non anterior cingulate cortex glutamate (ACC Glu) neurons and their downstream \npathways, and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic \nstimulation (rTMS). Methods An NMS-induced MCI model was established in Dam, \nand maternal behaviors were quantitatively assessed via retrieval latency, mother -pup \ninteraction duration, and crouching time. Multimodal neural circuit analyses were \nemployed, including c-Fos-based whole-brain activity mapping, viral-mediated neural \ntracing, chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations, in vivo calcium imaging, and \nelectrophysiological recordings. Additionally, resting -state functional  magnetic \nresonance imaging  (rs-fMRI) was conducted to examine ACC -centered circuit \ndysregulation in human volunteers with MCI.  Results (1) NMS induced progressive \\nMCI in Dam, accompanied by hyperactivation of ACCGlu neurons, as revealed by c-Fos \nmapping. (2) Chemogenetic inhibition of ACC Glu neurons or their projections to the \nparaventricular nucleus (PVN) alleviated MCI , while activating ACC Glu →PVN \npathways mimicked MCI in Dam. (3) Circuit tracing identified a tripartite pathway in \nwhich ACCGlu neurons form excitatory synapses onto PVN corticotropin -releasing \nhormone (CRH) neurons, which in turn suppress medial preoptic area GABAergic \n(MPAGABA) activity. Genetic knockdown of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 in PVNCRH \nneurons rescued MCI phenotypes.  (4) rTMS in tervention normalized ACC Glu \nhyperactivity, suppressed PVNCRH neuronal activity, restored MPAGABA function, and \nimproved maternal behaviors in NMS-Dam. Clinically, rTMS reduced ACC excitability \nand enhanced maternal care scores in human, correlating with diminished ACC -\nhypothalamic functional connectivity. Conclusions NMS triggers persistent MCI via \nACCGlu-driven hyperactivity, which engages GluR1-dependent post-synaptic signaling \nin PVN CRH neurons to inhibit MPA GABA activity. Targeting the ACCGlu→PVNCRH→\nMPAGABA circuit or non-invasive rTMS treatment effectively rescues MCI, providing \nnovel translational interventions for trauma-related parenting disorders. \nKeywords: Maternal care impairment; ACC glutamate neurons; corticotropin-\nreleasing hormone; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ; functional magnetic \nresonance imaging", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25063017244836.pdf"}, {"title": "The Shared Ascending Tongue-to-Brain Pathway for Trigeminal-Mediated Spiciness and Coolness Coding Mechanisms", "text": "The Shared Ascending Tongue-to-Brain Pathway for \nTrigeminal-Mediated Spiciness and Coolness Coding \nMechanisms \n \nFu-Qiang LIU1,2, Kun CUI1, Jing-Rong W ANG1, Chen ZHANG1, Lu-Lu GUO1, Si-Si RUAN1,2, \nJian MAO1,2,*, Jian-Ping XIE1,2,* \n \n1Beijing Life Science Academy (BLSA), Beijing 102209, China \n2Flavour Science Research Center, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou \n450001, China  \n \n*Corresponding author \n \nE-mail: 20012188mj@163.com (Jian MAO); xiejian8065_cn@sina.com (Jian-Ping XIE) \n \nAbstract: Objective The trigeminal nerve-mediated chemesthesis provides critical discriminative \ninput during flavor perception.

Chronic infraorbital \nnerve constriction (CION) serves as a widely accepted animal model to mimic trigeminal neuralgia \nand its associated mood disorders. However, the activities of DRN serotonergic neurons during \ntrigeminal neuralgia -associated affective behaviors remain unclear.  Methods Adult mice were \nsubjected to chronic infraorbital nerve constriction (CION) surgery to model trigeminal neuralgia, \nwhile sham-operated mice served as controls. Behavioral assessments were conducted at \npostoperative day 14 for anxiety-like behaviors using the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and Open Field \nTest (OFT), and for depression -like behaviors using the Forced Swim  Test (FST) and Tail \nSuspension Test (TST). To investigate DRN activation, immunohistochemistry was performed to \ndetect c-Fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation and TPH2 as a marker of serotonergic \nneurons. Mice were exposed to acute pain stimulation and TST at postoperative day 7 and 14 \nrespectively. Results (1) Behavioral assessments revealed that CION induced significant mechanical \nallodynia, anxiety-like behaviors and depression-like behaviors. (2) No significant difference in the \nproportion of c-Fos+/TPH2+ double-labeled neurons among total TPH2+ neurons between sham and \nCION groups after pain stimulation. (3) Compared to sham animals, the proportion of c-Fos+/TPH2+ \ndouble-labeled cells in the DRN was decreased in CION animals following TS stimulation.  \nConclusion These findings suggest that the emergence of anxiety and depression -like behaviors \nfollowing CION occurs independently of observable changes in DRN serotonergic neuron activation. \n \nKeywords: Dorsal Raphe Nucleus; chronic pain; anxiety and depression-like behaviors", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051423512934.pdf"}, {"title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation attenuates visceral pain by suppressing mPFC activity in rodents and patients with irritable bowel syndrome", "text": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation attenuates visceral\npain by suppressing mPFC activity in rodents and patients with\nirritable bowel syndrome\nRui-Xia Weng1, Fu-Chao Zhang2, Qian Sun1, Shuman Jia1, Yong-Chang Li2, Guang-Yin Xu1,2, Rui\nLi1\n1 Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou\n215006, P.

Behaviors linking sensation to action are governed by the precise interplay of neurons across multiple spatial scales. However, circuit computations are often inferred solely from neuronal activity, without directly observing the underlying connections. Here, we present a novel system based on a custom-built 2-photon microscope that enables multiscale optogenetic interrogation of effective connectivity. This system is applied to study circuit computations in the mouse olfactory bulb. Methods: Our system integrates a large-scale 1-photon patterned illumination pathway (DMD) with a high-resolution holographic 2-photon stimulation pathway (spatial light modulator). This allows for imaging of numerous neurons (100s-1,000s) within a 2-mm field of view at subcellular resolution. We demonstrate the capability to identify neurons based on sensory tuning and effective input. In the olfactory bulb, we used DMD stimulation to activate glomerular channels expressing ChR2 and identify mitral and tufted cells receiving input. We then investigated effective connections between mitral and tufted cells using holographic stimulation. Additionally, we developed an all-optical approach to map connectivity between glomeruli and mitral/tufted cells while monitoring odor-evoked responses. Results: We demonstrated our ability to identify groups of mitral and tufted cells receiving direct input from their parent glomerulus. Stimulation of glomerular channels revealed functional interactions. We found that glomeruli and mitral/tufted cells activated earliest in a sniff robustly represented odor identity across concentrations, while later-activated mitral/tufted cells were variable. We identified a brief temporal window of excitability at the sniff's start, followed by prolonged odor-evoked inhibition. Holographic stimulation revealed a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory influences between mitral cells.

The predation \nprocess exhibits substantial variability, as predators must accurately identify ever-changing sensory \ncues from prey  and timely adjust behavioral outputs based on internal drives. While the neural \ncircuitry underlying stereotyped sequential stages during predation has been well established, the \ndynamic modulation of this process remains poorly understood. Here, we used larval zebrafish as a \nvertebrate model to study the neuromodulation underlying visually-guided prey capture. We found \nthat anterior-medial optic tectum (amOT), responding most strongly to natural prey during predation, \nreceives innervations from pretectal dopaminergic (PreDA) neurons. Ablation of PreDA neurons \nobviously impaired prey capture, affecting both the ability to perceive prey and the continuity of \npredation. Next, we identified the visual responsiveness of PreDA neurons, which preferentially \nrespond to large bright dots that mimic the approach of prey. This responsiveness may be attributed \nto synaptic inputs from retinal arborization AF9. Besides, we found that PreDA signals were \ngradually accumulated and highly correlated with eye convergence and capture strike behavior \nduring the approach of prey, suggesting that these signals may encode motivational salience and  \npromote the execution of attacks. In conclusion, o ur study offers new insights into how visually-\nresponsive dopaminergic neurons timely modulate the perception of prey to facilitate the successful \nexecution of prey capture.  \n \nKey words: Pretectal dopaminergic neurons, Prey capture, Neuromodulation, Motivational \nsalience, Zebrafish", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051522233569.pdf"}, {"title": "A deficit of the dorsal CA3 to the dorsomedial hypothalamus circuit led to dysfunction of risk exploration and defense in TLE", "text": "A deficit of the dCA3 to the DMH circuit led to dysfunction of risk\nexploration and defense in TLE\nLiCHEN1,2,Yi CAO1,Chongyang SUN1,3,Yi LU1,*Cheng ZHONG1,*\n1Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain Connectome and Behavior, CAS Key Laboratory of\nBrain Connectome and Manipulation, the Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute, Shenzhen\nInstitute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen-Hong Kong Institute of\nBrain Science-Shenzhen Fundamental Research Institutions\n2Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen,\nGuangdong, PR China\n3Shenzhen College of Advanced Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen,\n518055, China.\n*Corresponding author\nE-mail:cheng.zhong@siat.ac.cn\nluyi@siat.ac.cn\nAbstract:Objective Exploratory behavior is an innate animal drive to actively investigate\nenvironments, enabling survival resource acquisition and predator avoidance through information\ngathering about novel surroundings.

Typically, the activation of inhibitory GABAergic neurons suppresses\nepileptic activity. However, recent studies suggest that the activation of certain GABAergic circuits in\nthe brain may paradoxically promote seizures, potentially contributing to the development of\ntreatment-resistant epilepsy.In our preliminary research, we observed increased activity of GABAergic\nneurons in the lateral septum (LS) during epileptic seizures, leading us to hypothesize that LS\nGABAergic neuronal activity may facilitate epileptogenesis. Therefore, we adopt to use optogenetic\nand chemogenetic techniques to modulate the activity of LS GABAergic neurons in order to investigate\nthe role of LS GABAergic neurons in epilepsy.Methods ：We used multiple research methods to\ninvestigate the circuit mechanism of lateral septum (LS) GABAergic neurons in epilepsy, including\nimmunofluorescence staining, fiber photometry-based calcium imaging, optogenetics, chemogenetics,\nelectroencephalography (EEG), a kainic acid (KA)-induced acute seizure model, an intracranial\ndrug-delivery epilepsy model and so on.First,an acute epilepsy model was established by\nintraperitoneal injection of KA.Subsequent immunofluorescence staining and c-Fos labeling revealed\nsignificant co-localization of GABAergic neurons and c-Fos in the LS, indicating their activation\nduring epileptic episodes. Further, real-time calcium imaging was employed to monitor dynamic\nactivity changes in LS GABAergic neurons during seizures.To functionally assess their role,\noptogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations were applied during both acute and chronic phases of\nepilepsy, enabling precise modulation of LS GABAergic neuronal activity. These experiments aim to\ndetermine whether LS GABAergic neurons exert pro- or anti-epileptic effects, thereby elucidating their\nunderlying circuit mechanisms in epilepsy.Results：Immunofluorescence staining revealed significant\nactivation of LS GABAergic neurons during epileptic seizures, indicating their involvement in epileptic\nnetwork dynamics. To further investigate the role of LS GABAergic neurons, we performed\nsimultaneous calcium imaging and EEG recordings in Vgat-cre mice, which demonstrated\nsynchronized activity between LS GABAergic neuronal calcium signals and EEG changes during\nseizures.Using optogenetic manipulation in acute seizure models, we found that photoactivation of LS\nGABAergic neurons suppressed seizure activity, whereas their photoinhibition exacerbated\nseizures.Subsequent chemogenetic manipulation in chronic epilepsy model yielded consistent results,\nvalidating the optogenetic findings.Conclusion：Enhanced activity of LS GABAergic neurons during\nepileptic seizures suggests their potential seizure-promoting effect. This finding indicates that\nactivation of these neurons may contribute to the development of certain forms of drug-resistant\nepilepsy.Notably, both optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of LS GABAergic neurons were found\nto exacerbate seizure activity, while their inhibition alleviated epileptic seizures.This might be due to\nthe complex microcircuits existing in the brain. Clarifying the mechanism of action of LS GABAergic\nneurons will help us better understand the generation mechanism of refractory epilepsy from the\nperspective of neural circuits and provide new potential targets for the treatment of refractory epilepsy.\nKeywords:Epilepsy;Lateral septal nucleus;GABA;Calcium fiber photometry;optogenetics; chemical\ngenetics", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061916383146.pdf"}, {"title": "A Somato-Hypothalamic Pathway Underlying Sustained Acupuncture Effects on Post-Traumatic Hypervigilance", "text": "A Somato-Hypothalamic Pathway Underlying Sustained\nAcupuncture Effects on Post-Traumatic Hypervigilance\nJunchen Liu1,2,6, Yangming Zhang1,6, Guaiguai Ma1,6, Baowen Dong1,3, Jinyi Xie1, Yang Liu1, Kezi\nLi1, Cancan Liu4, Dayun Feng3, Tiaotiao Liu5, Baolin Guo1,2*, Shengxi Wu1,2,7*\n1Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medicine, Fourth Military Medical University,\nXi’an, China.\n2The Shaanxi Province Key Laboratory of Brain Function Analysis and Modulation, Xi’an, China\n3Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, China.\n4Nuohai Life Science (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China\n5School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China\n6These authors contributed equally\n7Lead contact\n*Correspondence: baolguo@fmmu.edu.cn (B.G.), shengxi@fmmu.edu.cn (S.W.)\nAbstract: Clinical observations suggest that acupuncture at specific somatic sites may exert\ntherapeutic effects beyond analgesia and anti-inflammation, potentially modulating threat-induced\nhyperarousal; however, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear.

The involvement \nof corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a \ncrucial role in modulating behavioral responses to stressful situations. In this study utilizing a mouse \nmodel of social defeat stress (SDS), we demonstrate how coordinated activation and localized \nrelease of CRF within the mPFC contribute to promoting adaptive responses under stressful \nconditions leading to enhanced resilience against subsequent challenges. Specifically, during SDS \nexposure, heightened activity levels were observed among mPFC CRF neurons coincide with \nincreased local release triggered by active exploration and defensive beh aviors, while decreased \nresponses were detected upon exposure to aggression. Interestingly , the CRF neural activity and \nlocal release responding to coping behaviors throughout chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) differed \nbetween susceptible and resilient m ice. Furthermore, activation of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) \nsignaling in the mPFC enhanced active coping behaviors and conferred resilience to CSDS, while \ninhibition of CRF system promoted passive coping behaviors and induced susceptibility to sub -\nthreshold SDS. Additionally, inhibition of CRFR1 in the mPFC nullified the pro -resilience effect \nelicited by activation of CRF neurons during CSDS. The collective findings provide evidence \nsupporting the crucial role of local endogenous CRF derived from mPFC CRF neuron s in \nmaintaining resilience through active coping styles when confronted with social stress.

Recent studies indicate a therapeutic potential of increased brain endocannabinoids \n(eCBs) in anxiety disorders, but the underlying brain circuits are still elusive. The basolateral \namygdala (BLA) is an important hub for emotional processing, and one of its major downstream \nprojections is to the ventral hippocampus (vHPC).

Here, we established an exposure therapy paradigm in Hoxb8-/- mice, a classic model to study compulsive-like behaviors. Behavioral tests showed that the exposure therapy significantly decreased grooming episodes in Hoxb8-/- mice. Besides c-Fos immunohistochemical staining, circuit-specific in vivo fiber photometry also showed that decreased Ca²⁺ activity in ventral medial striatum (VMS)-projecting medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons and VMS-projecting orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neurons following exposure therapy in Hoxb8-/- mice. However, optogenetic manipulation of both pathways showed divergent effects on the behavioral changes of Hoxb8-/- mice. Activation of mPFC-VMS pathway abolished the exposure therapy effect, whereas OFC-VMS activation did not. Moreover, mPFC-VMS inhibition alleviated compulsive grooming behavior of Hoxb8-/- mice, but not the OFC-VMS pathway. Next we performed RNA sequencing of mPFC tissue dissected from Hoxb8-/- mice with or without exposure therapy. We found Shisa6, an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) auxiliary subunit, showed decreased expression in exposure therapy treated mice. Cell type specific knockdown of Shisa6 by RNAi reduced compulsive grooming behavior in Hoxb8-/- mice, while Shisa6 overexpression abolished the exposure therapy effect. Patch-clamp recording showed decreased AMPAR-mediated EPSC in both exposure therapy treated and Shisa6 knockdown mice compared to the control groups, respectively. These results suggest that our long-term exposure therapy downregulates Shisa6 expression in mPFC-VMS projecting neurons. And the study elucidates the potential mechanisms of ERP and provides a novel molecular target for the clinical treatment of refractory OCD.

We have previously identified the CCK precursor, neuropeptides,\nand receptors in Aplysia californica, with two functional receptors (CCKR1 and CCKR2)\ncharacterized through bioinformatic analysis and IP1 assays. However, the molecular mechanisms\nunderlying ligand-receptor interactions remain undefined. This study systematically investigates\nCCK neuropeptide-receptor interactions in Aplysia. Using SwissModel and Robetta for receptor\nstructural prediction and HPEPDOCK for molecular docking, we identified seven potential\ninteraction sites between CCKR1 and CCK neuropeptides. Site-directed mutagenesis combined\nwith receptor activation assays revealed three critical residues (L192, R200, K363) that mediate\nreceptor activation through π -Alkyl hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Parallel\ndocking analyses are being conducted for CCKR2 to identify key interaction sites involving\nhydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces, followed by functional validation through site\nmutagenesis. Through integrated AI-based protein structure prediction, molecular docking, and\nreceptor mutagenesis, this study delineates residue-specific ligand-receptor interaction\nmechanisms governing receptor activation in the Aplysia CCK signaling system.

This study investigates the neural circuits \nregulating uterine activity using viral tracing, behavioral analysis, and electrophysiological \nrecordings in an animal model. Methods (1) Three to seven days after injecting pseudorabies \nvirus (PRV) into the uterine horns, brains were prepared and scanned with a high-resolution \nconfocal microscope to check viral distribution in brain regions. (2) CTB-555 was injected into \nthe mouse amygdala (MeA/CeA). 3-5 days later, retrograde-tracing neurons were observed under \na fluorescence microscope.

In contrast, CTB injection into the \nCeA resulted in no infected neurons in the OB but significant infection in the MeA.

Giv en that \npharmacological interventions often yield limited therapeutic efficacy for refractory pain, physical \ntherapeutic modalities have emerged as a major focus of clinical research. Substantial clinical \nevidence demonstrates that stel late ganglion block (SGB) can significantly alleviate both chronic \npain and anxiety symptoms. However, the neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, \nthis study aims to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms involved in this therapeutic process. \nMethods This study employs a multidisciplinary approach integrating the chronic constriction \ninjury (CCI) model of the sciatic nerve with advanced methodologies including ethological \nassessment, optogenetics, in vitro electrophysiology, deep -tissue calcium imaging , polyethylene \nglycol associated solvent system (PEGASOS) , fiber photometry, neurotransmitter biosensors, \nproteomic profiling, and immunofluorescence staining. Through this multi -level investigation \nspanning neuronal, synaptic, and circuit -level analyses, we aim to systematically elucidate the \nperipheral-to-central neural mechanisms underlying the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of SGB.  \nResults (1) SGB treatment significantly alleviated pain hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors \nin CCI mice, while reducing the expression of the immediate early gene c -Fos in the superior \ncervical ganglion (SCG). Chemogenetic activation or inhibition of noradrene rgic SCG neurons \n(SCGNE) in DBH-Cre mice reversed or mimicked the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of SGB, \nrespectively. (2) Anterograde viral tracing and PEGASOS technology identified SCG projections to \npain- and emotion -related brain regions, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and \nnucleus accumbens (NAc). In vivo fiber photometry demonstrated that SGB reduced enhanced \nnorepinephrine (NE) signals in the S1 and NAc during pain and anxiety-like behavior tests in CCI \nmice. Calcium signals in S1 and NAC were markedly increased during pain and anxiety behaviors, \nrespectively. (3) Optogenetic and chemogenetic activation or inhibition of the SCGNE→S1GLU and \nSCGNE→NAcGABA circuits reversed or mimicked the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of SGB,  \nrespectively.

Methods We investigated how fluctuation \nof acetylcholine (ACh) and oxytocin (OXT) levels correlate with brain state changes and interact \nwith each other, using G -protein-coupled receptor activation-based acetylcholine (GRABACh3.0, \nGRABrACh1.4) and oxytocin (GRABOXT1.7) sensors with a fiber -photometric fluorescence \nreadout in mice.

Results (1) While ACh and OXT worked in \nparallel during NREM packets, transitions from NREM to REM were charact erized by a surge of \nACh and a further decrease of OXT. High A Ch was correlated with population synchrony and \ngamma oscillations during active waking but sharp wave ripples (SPW-R) of immobility and NREM \nwere associated with minima of ACh signal.

In this study, we \nexplored the impact of sevoflurane, a commonly used pediatric  anesthetic, on memory associated \ncircuits. We found that sevoflurane exposure during early development suppressed the excitatory \nneural circuit from the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) to the bed nucleus of the stria \nterminalis (BNST), impairing fear memory expression. While fear memory acquisition remained \nunaffected, fear memory expression was significantly reduced, as indicated by decreased freezing \nbehavior. Using fiber photometry, we showed reduced activity of CamkII α-positive excitatory \nneurons in both PVT and BNST after sevoflurane exposure. Chemogenetic activation of CamkIIα\n-positive neurons in both the PVT and BNST rescued fear memory expression deficits in \nsevoflurane-treated mice, whereas inhibition of BNST CamkIIα-positive neurons was sufficient to \ninduce similar deficits in fear memory expression in control mice.  Furthermore, activation of the \nPVT-to-BNST neural circuit reversed the behavioral deficits caused by sevoflurane, while inhibition \nof this circuit impaired fear memory expression in control mice. These findings highlight the PVT\n→BNST neural circuit as a critical pathway for anesthesia -related cognitive dysfunction and a \npotential target for future interventions. \nKeywords: Sevoflurane; Paraventricular Thalamic Nucleus; Bed Nucleus of The Stria Terminalis; \nCamkiiα-Positive Excitatory Neural Circuit; Juvenile Stage", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25062309472053.pdf"}, {"title": "An infralimbic cortex to lateral septal neural circuit mediates neonatal stress-induced anxiety in adult male mice", "text": "An infralimbic cortex to lateral septal neural circuit mediates \nneonatal stress-induced anxiety in adult male mice \n \nZheng-Yan ZHU1, Yong-Chang LI1, Guang-Yin XU1,* \n \n1Clinical Research Center of Neurological Disease, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric \nDiseases and Institute of Neuroscience, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, P .R.

Previous research has demonstrated its influence on decision-making; \nhowever, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. T his study investigates how \njealousy affects brain activity and decision-making processes, focusing on functional connectivity (FC) \nwithin the brain’s frontal and sensory regions. Methods A total of 69 healthy participants were recruited \nfor the experiment, with a focus on the emotional responses triggered by unequal reward distribution. \nTo induce feelings of jealousy, participants were subjected to a series of tasks involving rewards that \nwere distributed unequally. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to monitor brain \nactivity, specifically oxygenated hemoglobin (ΔHbO) levels, in response to the tasks. Participants \ncompleted a color identification test under conditions of both high and low reward distribution to assess \ndecision-making abilities.  Results The results revealed significant changes in brain functional \nconnectivity (FC) between regions implicated in cognitive and emotional processing, including the pre-\nmotor, supplementary motor cortex, and the inferior prefrontal gyrus. The low-reward group exhibited \ndecreased functional connectivity in key brain regions associated with attention and emotional \nregulation during decision -making tasks. Conversely, the high -reward group showed enhanced \nconnectivity, particularly in areas related to sensory processing and motor coordination, suggesting that \nthe anticipation of higher rewards facilitated better cognitive performance. These findings were further \ncorroborated by behavioral data, with the high -reward group demonstrating faster reaction times and \nhigher accuracy on the color identification test. On the other hand, the low -reward group exhibited \nprolonged reaction times, indicating the cognitive cost of negative emotional responses associated with \njealousy. Additionally, the low-reward group experienced higher levels of cognitive load, which were \nreflected in the weaker FC and slower decision-making.

Results (1) \nThe behavioral results confirmed that propofol CPP was promoted in rats, and the expressions of \nmGluR5, the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, D1R, p -ERK1/2 and p -CREB in the vHPC were \nsignificantly upregulated by the pretreatment of D-AP5 in the vCA1. (2) The locomotor activity was \nnot changed by the D -AP5 pretreatment. (3) The propofol CPP was  significantly suppressed by \nchemogenetic inhibition of  the vCA1, which can be  reversed by the pretreatment of D -AP5. \nConclusion These evidence supports a vital role of NMDAR in the vCA1 in modulating propofol \nCPP, and suggest the central reward processing may function through  mGluR5 and NMDAR-\nD1R/ERK/CREB signaling pathway.  \nKeywords: Propofol, CPP, the ventral CA1, NMDAR", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060910225776.pdf"}, {"title": "Effects of ANKS1B in nucleus accumbens on Extended-Access Cocaine Self-Administration in Rats", "text": "Effects ofANKS1B in nucleus accumbens on Extended-Access\nCocaine Self-Administration in Rats\nLiping Yang1, Jianfeng Liu2, Yan Sun1*\n1National Institute on Drug Dependence, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China\n2College of Life Sciences and Health, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430000, P.R. China\n*Corresponding author\nE-mail:sunyan@bjmu.edu.cn\nAbstract: Objective Cocaine dependence are characterized by compulsive drug-seeking despite\nharmful consequences. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region implicated in drug\nabuse, has been a focal point for research in this area. Casual drug use transitions into compulsive\ndrug-taking in part due to epigenetic mechanisms in NAc. Our prior investigations have revealed\nthat ANKS1B is a significant genetic risk factor shared by heroin and methamphetamine addiction.\nSpecifically, overexpression of ANKS1B in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been shown to\nreduce rats' susceptibility to addictive substances. Nevertheless, the specific role and underlying\nmechanisms of ANKS1B in cocaine use disorder remain to be elucidated. The present study aims\nto investigate the role of ANKS1B expression in the NAc in behaviors associated with cocaine\naddiction. Methods Viruses designed to knock down or overexpress ANKS1B were bilaterally\ninjected into the NAc of rats, establishing both overexpression and knockdown models. A cocaine\nself-administration model was employed to compare the behavioral responses of these rats with\nthose of control animals in cocaine self-administration experiments. Following extend cocaine\nself-administration, cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior was assessed on days 1 and 28 of\nwithdrawal. To delve into the mechanisms of ANKS1B in long-term cocaine self-administration, a\ncombination of neurobiological techniques, including RNA-Seq, immunofluorescence, and\nWestern Blot, was utilized. Results (1) Overexpression of ANKS1B in the NAc led to a significant\nreduction in long-term cocaine self-administration and post-withdrawal drug-seeking behaviors in\nrats. Conversely, ANKS1B knockdown produced opposing effects. (2) Golgi staining\ndemonstrated that ANKS1B overexpression in the NAc resulted in a marked decrease in dendritic\nspine density following prolonged cocaine self-administration. (3) ANKS1B was identified to\ninteract with the CBP HAT domain. (4)RNA-seq analysis of the NAc following prolonged cocaine\nself-administration uncovered that ANKS1B regulates 556 genes, which are predominantly\nenriched in the FOXO signaling pathway. (5) ANKS1B was shown to govern FOXO3 acetylation\nby modulating the CBP-FOXO3 interaction, thus playing a mediating role in cocaine addiction\nbehaviors. Conclusion Overexpression of ANKS1B in the NAc impacted cocaine intake in\nextended but not restricted access rats and may be a potential pharmacological strategy for the\ntreatment of cocaine addiction.\nKeywords: Cocaine Addiction; Epigenetics ;ANKS1B; FOXO3a", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051321171030.pdf"}, {"title": "Evaluation of the addiction potential of 6-methylnicotine and 4-methylnicotine in a rat self-administration model", "text": "Evaluation of the addiction potential of 6-methylnicotine and 4 -\nmethylnicotine in a rat self-administration model \n \nYi-Jun LIU1,2, Xiao LI1,2, Shu-Lei HAN1,2, Huan CHEN1,2, Hong-Wei HOU1,2* \n \n1China National Tobacco Quality Supervision & Test Center, Zhengzhou 450001, China \n2Beijing Life Science Academy, Beijing 102200, China \n \n*Corresponding author \n \nE-mail: qsfctc@163.com \n \nAbstract: Objective Methylated nicotine analogs, such as 6 -methylnicotine (6MN) has been \nincreasingly detected in emerging nicotine -containing products including e -cigarettes and oral \npouches.

Although the role of white \nmatter (WM) function in neuropsychiatric disorders has gained in creasing attention, systematic \nstudies comparing the sensitivity of WM and gray matter (GM) in capturing disease -related \nfunctional abnormalities remain scarce.

We used two separate \nmachine learning models  (XGBoost): one to assess the effectiveness of abnormal topological \nindices in disease classification, and another to identify impulsivity severity. A series of validation \nanalyses were also conducted to test the robustness of the results.

In this study, we propose and test the hypothesis that basal forebrain \ncholinergic neurons rapidly modulate hippocampal CA1 neuronal representations of distinct CS \nand regulate temporal associative learning through dynamic changes in short-term memory trace \nmaintenance of CS.

Many PTSD symptoms do not show up right after the trauma, but rather \nprogressively develop in the post -trauma period. Using animal models for time -dependent fear \ngeneralization (termed fear incubation), prior studies have revealed some important brain areas \ncritical for fear incubation including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventral hippocampus \n(vHPC). However, neural mechanisms underlying fear incubation remain poorly understood. Using \nchemogenetic inhibition of ACC neurons during the contextual fear incubation paradigm, we found \nthat ACC neurons were required for the progressive development of fear generalization but not the \nretrieval of generalized fear. Furthermore, we used miniscope recording to investigate the neuronal \ndynamics in ACC at different time points during the fear incubation. At the single -cell level, we \nfound an increase in the proportion of non- context cell and the decrease in context discrimination \nindex.

This ability is essential for adapting to complex and  dynamic \nenvironments. The neural mechanisms underlying generalization are intricate and multilayered, \nrequiring orderly cooperation between different brain regions. Previous research has indicated that \nthe hippocampus (HPC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) participate in the generalization of concepts, \nspatial and non -spatial structures, and sequential information, functioning in a complementary \nmanner during this process. However, there has been relatively limited research on the \ngeneralization of more complex task rules. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that HPC and OFC \nplay crucial roles in the generalization of rules: Methods We developed an odor-guided abstract \nrule behavior task and performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the HPC and OF C to \ninvestigate whether rats could learn abstract rule relationships between discrete odor cues and \nexplore the specific representations within these two regions. Results Behavioral data showed that \nrats c ould learn abstract task rules and adjust their behavior according to expectations. In vivo  \nelectrophysiological recordings demonstrated that OFC neurons selectively encoded abstract rules, \nwith this encoding capable of generalizing across different odor positions, while HPC neurons also \nexhibited generalized rule encoding but  showed stronger context -dependence than OFC . \nConclusion These findings suggest a division of labor: HPC encodes context -bound rule \nrepresentations, while OFC drives generalization by abstracting rules beyond specific contexts. \nKeywords: Generalization; hippocampus; orbitofrontal cortex; single-unit; rat; context; odor", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051410433525.pdf"}, {"title": "Cognitive control mechanism differentiation and hierarchicality in cross-modal and cross-channel semantic integration - a systematic review", "text": "Cognitive control mechanism differentiation and\nhierarchicality in cross-modal and cross-\nchannel semantic integration - a systematic\nreview\nZiting Liu1, Xueping Hu*\n1, * College ofEducation, Huaibei Normal University; Anhui Engineering Research\nCenter of Cognitive Behavioral Intelligent Computing and Application; Research\nCenter ofHigher\nEducation, Huaibei, Anhui 235000, China\n*Corresponding author\nE- mail:huxpxp@163.com\nAbstract: Cross-modal and cross-channel semantic integration are core abilities that enable\nhumans to adapt to complex linguistic environments. This paper reviews relevant\nneuroscientific evidence on integration to clarify the hierarchical differentiation and neural\nspecificity of cognitive control in conflict resolution. First, cross-modal integration (e.g.,\naudiovisual conflict) is rapidly processed in the early stages of conflict (approximately 150\nms) by the superior temporal sulcus (STS) through high-frequency gamma oscillations (30–\n80 Hz); cross-channel integration (e.g., semantic-intonation conflict) is delayed to the late\nstages (300–500 ms), relying on low-frequency θ waves (4–8 Hz) synchronized between the\nanterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to dynamically\nregulate response thresholds (e.g., suppressing interference), with efficiency constrained by\nworking memory capacity. Second, cross-modal integration is dominated by the sensory-\ntemporal network (STS-AG functional connectivity), accompanied by default mode\nnetwork (DMN) inhibition; cross-channel integration relies on the central executive\nnetwork (CEN) and salience network (SN) collaboration (ACC initial conflict screening,\nDLPFC resource allocation, AI attention bias regulation). Dynamic causal models further\nreveal that in cross-modal conflicts, the information flow from STS to AG dominates, while\nin cross-channel conflicts, the efficiency of ACC to DLPFC transmission determines\nbehavioral costs. This study suggests that cross-modal integration may rely on prior\nexperience to predict and integrate multi-sensory signals, while cross-channel integration\ntends to adjust strategies dynamically based on conflict monitoring. This finding helps\nclarify the differences between the two and the hierarchical nature of cognitive control,\nproviding new insights for language integration theory.\nKeywords: cross-modal integration; cross-channel integration; cognitive\ncontrol mechanisms; neural differentiation; hierarchicality", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060910115137.pdf"}, {"title": "Adaptive reward representations integrate expected uncertainty signals in orbitofrontal cortex", "text": "Adaptive reward representations integrate expected uncertainty \nsignals in orbitofrontal cortex \n \nQianru ZHANG1, Jingfeng ZHOU2 * \n \n1School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University & Chinese Institute for Brain \nResearch, Beijing 100069, China. \n2State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University & \nSchool of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University & Chinese Institute for Brain \nResearch, Beijing 100875, China. \n \n*Corresponding author \n \nE-mail: jingfengzhou@bnu.edu.cn \n \nAbstract: Incorporating expected uncertainty into reward evaluation is critical for adaptive \nlearning and behavior.

Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons project to several downstream brain regions, mediating distinct fear memory modulation. Among these, DA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) reward circuit have been proven to be a key element in fear memory. Astrocytic involvement in NAc-mediated memory regulation remains poorly understood. This study specifically investigates how NAc astrocytes modulate fear memory retrieval through dopaminergic mechanisms. Method: Through integrated in vivo fiber photometry in free moving mice, we monitored astrocytic calcium dynamics triggered by stress stimulation on conditioning training day, coupled with chemogenetic activation of Gq on astrocytes and astrocytic D1R knockdown to mechanistically dissect the role of astrocytes in the modulation of fear memory. Results: (1) Chemogenetic activation of NAc astrocytes induced astrocyte calcium elevation and had no effect on locomotor activity in free moving mice. (2) During the formation of fear memory, astrocyte-specific manipulation of Gq signaling in NAc astrocytes attenuated the freezing behavior induced by contextual cues and reduced anxiety-like behavior. (3) Astrocytic deletion of D1R in NAc impaired both cued and contextual memory retrieval and reduced anxiety-like behavior. Conclusion: Our findings revealed that VTA-NAc dopamine signaling activates NAc astrocytes through D1Rs, which regulate fear learning and memory via neuron-astrocyte interaction, highlighting astrocyte D1Rs as a therapeutic target for fear-related disorders.

While contextual factors (e.g. stimulus position) can affect generalization, the roles of different cue and stimulus type remain unclear. Based on multiple-systems theory (e.g., COVIS model), this study examined how context change impacts transfer performance, focusing on task type (Rule-Based, RB vs. Information-Integration, II) and stimulus type (naturalistic trees vs. geometric gratings). Methods Participants were trained on categorization tasks over 8 feedback blocks (50 trials each). In the control phase, they completed a no-feedback test in the same context. In the test phase, contextual cues (e.g., background image: morning vs. evening) were altered while category boundaries remained constant. A 2×2×2 within-subject design (Task Type × Stimulus Type × Phase) was used to examine whether learning was abstract or context-bound. Results Results revealed a significant interaction between task and stimulus. For tree stimuli, II tasks showed lower accuracy in the test phase, suggesting transfer failure due to context change. RB tasks with trees showed no significant performance drop, indicating better abstraction. For grating stimuli, both RB and II tasks showed reduced accuracy in the test phase, suggesting low-level perceptual anchoring. Conclusion Findings support the COVIS model: RB tasks, linked to explicit systems, promote more transferable knowledge, while II tasks rely on implicit systems sensitive to context. Stimulus properties further modulate this effect—naturalistic versus geometric inputs may engage different learning strategies. This study highlights how learning systems and perceptual context jointly shape the flexibility of category knowledge.

Specifically, astrocytic Gq-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a key initiator of astrocytic Ca²⁺ signaling, has been implicated in regulating the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) expression and function to maintain glutamate homeostasis. Evidence reveals concurrent EAAT2 depletion and astrocytic Ca²⁺ dysregulation in neurodegeneration, suggesting that astrocytic GqRs activation may bridge Ca²⁺ signaling to EAAT2 regulation and then cognitive modulation. Methods We manipulated endogenous mGluR5 via AAV-shRNA or antagonist intracerebroventricular infusion and exogenous GqRs activation with AAV-hM3Dq in CA1 astrocytes. GCaMP6f fiber photometry recorded spontaneous and task-evoked Ca²⁺dynamics during novel object recognition (NOR) across GqRs manipulation models. Results (1) mGluR5 knockdown in astrocytes reduced both Ca²⁺ transients and EAAT2 expression, whereas chemogenetic activation of hM3Dq elevated Ca²⁺ and enhanced EAAT2 expression.

While transcriptional mechanisms have been well characterized, less is known about localized post-transcriptional regulation at synapses. Here, we identify N¹-methyladenosine (m¹A) as a dynamic RNA modification enriched in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) following extinction training. Synaptic m¹A accumulates in activity-dependent patterns and facilitates the expression of key plasticity-related transcripts, including Pten. Disruption of synaptic m¹A deposition impairs extinction memory without affecting baseline behavior.

To this extend, we recently demonstrated that learning-dependent changes in large-scale neuronal dynamics and plasticity of single cell responses in MGB encode sensory as well as task-related information (Hasegawa, et al., 2024), highlighting MGB’s function in encoding relevant information for adaptive behaviours.

Method: Here we investigated the neuronal dynamics of MGB during a frequency discrimination decision-making task followed by an open exploration and sleep session using longitudinal calcium imaging with miniature microscopes combined with electrophysiological recording and multimodal behavioural tracking.  Results: During open field sessions, mice explored the arena unrestrained and showed a variety of complex behaviours including episodes of sleep. To dissect sleep stages, we adapted the EEG-NET (Lawhern, 2016) algorithm using dual channel EEG recordings to identify episodes of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. We use ASOID (Tillmann, Hsu, et al. 2024) to disentangle the awake behavioural repertoires. We find selected ensembles of MGB neurons that exhibit distinct activity patterns that are phase-locked to various cortical EEG stages, while embeddings of population Ca2+ activity and behavioural labels revealed neural dynamics that resembles separate sleep phases.

The dentate \ngyrus (DG), a subregion of the hippocampus, has been specifically implicated in contextual \nlearning and pattern separation , the process by which highly similar environmental cues are \nencoded as distinct, non -overlapping memory representations to support accurate memory \ndiscrimination. This function is essential for accurate memor y retrieval and the prevention of \nmemory generalization. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms by which pattern \nseparation fails, leading to inappropriate memory generalization, remain unresolved. Dopamine \n(DA), a key neuromodulator, acts primarily through two families of G protein-coupled receptors: \nthe D1-like receptors (D1R and D5R), which are generally excitatory, and the D2-like receptors \n(D2R, D3R and D4R), which are more inhibitory. Our previous work has shown that DA and its \nD1Rs in the DG facilitate hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and synaptic plasticity \nin rats, but its specific role in accurate memory retrieval and prevention of memory \ngeneralization has not been clarified.  \nResults: 1. Behavioral training for fear memory retrieval significantly elevated endogenous DA \nlevels and increased D1Rs and D2Rs in the DG, indicating an active role for DA signaling during \nfear memory retrieval. 2. DG engram cells, labeled by c-Fos expression following fear memory \nretrieval, exhibited surface expression of both D1 Rs and D2 Rs. This suggests that DA may \ncontribute to fear memory retrieval by modulating the activity of memory -encoding neuronal \nensembles in the DG. 3. Exogenous DA administration enhanced memory discrimination and \nreduced generalized fear responses, whereas local inhibition of D1R in the DG using SCH23390 \nimpaired memory discrimination and promoted generalization. 4. The ventral tegmental area \n(VTA) serves as a critical source of dopaminergic input to the DG. Selective ablation of tyrosine \nhydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons, but not glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons \nin the VTA impaired memory discrimination and resulted in increased contextual generalization. \nThese findings underscore the functional significance of VTA-derived dopaminergic projections \nin modulating the precision of fear memory retrieval.  \nConclusion: DA via its receptor enhances the precision of fear memory retrieval by modulating \nDG engram cell and promoting granule cell-mediated discrimination. \n \nKey Words:  dopamine; dentate gyrus; fear memory retrieval; memory discrimination and \ngeneralization  \n \nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (32160195) and \nJilin Scientifc and Technological Development Program (YDZJ202201ZYTS255)", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051514441678.pdf"}, {"title": "Compressed representations underpin knowledge awareness in sequence learning", "text": "Compressed representations underpin knowledge awareness in \nsequence learning \nHaoran Jiang1, #, Xiuyan Guo2, 3, #, Yang Lu2, 3, *, Shaobo Xu4, Guanglong Liu3, Xianting Shen1, \nXue Weng5, Fumin Li2 \n1School of Social Development and Public Policy, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. \n2Fudan Institute on Ageing, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. \n3Ministry of Education (MOE) Laboratory for National Development and Intelligent Governance, \nFudan University, Shanghai, China. \n4School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. \n5School of psychology and cognitive science, East China Normal University, Shanghai , China. \n#These authors contributed equally to this work: Haoran Jiang, Xiuyan Guo. \n*Corresponding author \nE-mail: yang_lu@fudan.edu.cn \nAbstract: Objective Humans excel at extracting sequential patterns from the environment. \nSequence knowledge can be acquired implicitly as abstract structures that generalize beyond \nindividual elements and, over time, transition into conscious, verbalizable knowledge.

This morphological characteristic distinguishes\nChinese from most Indo-European languages. Current theories of compound word processing\ninclude full-decomposition model, full-listing model, and dual-route model, with the cohort model\nbeing a dominant framework for auditory word processing. While studies have examined\nhomophone density, word frequency, and semantic transparency, the timing of how these features\nare processed in Chinese auditory compounds remains unclear. Methods To investigate the\ntemporal dynamics of Chinese auditory compound word processing and examine whether its\nunderlying mechanism involves a decomposition-integration process, we recorded scalp\nelectroencephalography (EEG) from 40 healthy adults when they were listening to 500-ms\ntwo-character compound words and performing a 1-n back task. Using multivariate pattern\nanalysis (MVPA), we decoded neural responses to different words and words sharing initial\nsyllables. We also analyzed temporal generalization patterns and used representational similarity\nanalysis (RSA) to examine the neural dynamics induced by acoustic information, homophone\ndensity of the initial syllable, character/word frequency and word semantic transparency. We used\ncluster-based permutation tests for statistical analysis and performed bootstrap tests to identify the\nonset and peak latencies of decoding accuracy and Spearman correlation waveforms in each\ncondition. Results Group-level analysis showed that distinct compound words could be decoded\nat 67 ms, whereas words sharing initial sounds were not discriminated until 342 ms after stimulus\nonset. Temporal generalization matrix revealed an oscillatory neural processing pattern. RSA\nresults demonstrated that acoustic information was first decoded at 80 ms post-stimulus onset and\nremained statistically significant throughout most of the time window. First-character frequency\neffects appeared at 150–180 ms and 240–290 ms while second-character frequency appeared at\n480–510 ms and 720–750 ms. Whole-word frequency emerged at 720–750 ms, overlapping with\nthe second time window of second-character’s significant representation. Semantic transparency\neffects occurred at 130–150 ms and 300–340 ms, temporally aligned with the presentation of each\nsyllable respectively. These results demonstrate that both constituent morphemes undergo\ndecomposition processing, while whole-word representation emerges during later lexical\nintegration stages. Additionally, homophone density effects appeared at 160–220 ms, matching the\ncohort model's predictions for auditory word recognition and the initial-morpheme advantage\neffect. Conclusion The current findings support: (1) the hybrid representation of constituent and\nwhole-word processing, (2) the cohort model’s access-selection-integration framework, and (3)\ninitial-morpheme advantage in auditory compound word recognition. Our research has contributed\nto a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying compound word\nprocessing.

Synaptic plasticity in\nanterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is assumed to be a crucial interface for pain perception and\nemotion. Laminin  1 (LAMB1), a key element of extracellular matrix (ECM) in ACC was\nrecently revealed to invole in the development of neuropathic pain and aversive emotion. Here, we\nuncover a key role of retinoic acid (RA)/RARβ signaling in neuropathic pain and associated\nanxiodepression via regulation of ECM homeostasis. We show that nerve injury reduces RA level\nin the serum and ACC in mice and human, which brings about downregulation of its\ncorresponding receptor, RARβ. Overexpressing RARβ relieves pain hypersensitivity and\ncomorbid anxiodepression, while silencing it exacerbates pain sensitivity and induces\nanxiodepression. Mechanistically, RARβ maintains ECM homeostasis via transcriptional\nregulation of LAMB1, reversing abnormal synaptic plasticity and eventually improves\nneuropathic pain and aversive emotion.

In this study, we leverage state-of-the-art neural language and music models to examine how words and music under varying levels of temporal compression are tracked by EEG responses. Methods We recorded 256-channel EEG from 36 right-handed native Mandarin speakers (19 females, mean age = 24.8 years, SD = 6.9). Participants passively listened to a 2-minute AI-synthesized Mandarin song presented at four playback speeds (4×, 3×, 2×, and 1×, in that order). For each word and music beat in the stimuli, we extracted semantic and rhythmic embeddings using a large language model and a large music model, respectively. Source-localized EEG epochs were then extracted from –100 ms to 500 ms relative to the offset of each word and beat at each speed condition. For each subject, we regressed word and beat embeddings against EEG signals across all playback speeds. We compared the coefficient of determination (R²) at the faster speeds (2×, 3×, and 4×) against the baseline (1×) condition. Results For speech processing, we observed significantly reduced activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) at 2×, 3×, and 4× playback speeds compared to the original (1×) speed. A similar pattern was found for music processing at 2× and 3× speeds, with decreased LATL activity. However, at 4× speed, music processing elicited a distinct significant cluster in the superior temporal regions relative to the 1× condition. Conclusion These findings suggest reduced comprehension for both speech and music at moderately compressed rates. At the highest compression, however, music processing appears to engage more low-level auditory regions, potentially reflecting more effort in the processing of acoustic detail.

Although the neural mechanisms of decision making have been extensively studied using perceptual tasks with binary stimulus categories such as motion direction discrimination, much less is known about how the brain maps many object identities into action plans during decision making. Here we show that neural population dynamics in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) reflect the transformation of high-dimensional, multiple object identity information into low-dimensional action plans. Monkeys performed a face identification task, in which they determined the identity of a face from 12 possible alternatives and made a Go/No-go choice, each of which was associated with half of the possible identities. The stimuli were generated from a parametric face space such that there was no common feature across the faces associated with the Go or No-go choices. We found that population neural dynamics in the vlPFC span two subspaces: a high-dimensional identity space that encodes each facial identity along an orthogonal axis, and a low-dimensional choice axis shared across facial identities associated with the same action. When the monkeys judged morphed intermediates between Go and No-go faces, the neural response in the identity space rotated between the two identity axes, whereas the neural response along the choice axis exhibited a weaker amplitude, mirroring weaker evidence for a decision. Early fluctuations of activity in the identity space were correlated with later fluctuations of activity in the choice space, suggesting information transfer. Put together, the vlPFC activity retains both high-dimensional visual object information and low-dimensional choice information, representing many-to-one transformation from object identities to action plans.

Globally, 40% of\npeople will experience at least one episode of syncope in their lifetime, with pain being one of the\nimportant factors triggering syncope, yet the mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to investigate\nthe spatial characteristics of brain-wide differentiated neuronal activation and their mitochondria\nchanges of the pain-induced syncope and offer a valuable reference for future brain-heart\ninteraction research.

The SCN is a network of neurochemically \nheterogeneous γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons. Multiple types of GABA neurons can be differentiated \nby the co-expressed neuropeptides. Arginine vasopressin (A VP)-producing GABAergic neurons in the SCN shell and \nvasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) -producing GABAergic neurons in the SCN core are the two of the major \nneuron types. We recently revealed that A VP neurons function as the primary determinant of circadian period in the \nSCN network and regulate other SCN neurons, including VIP neurons. Also, GABA released from A VP neurons \ncontrols the timing of SCN neuronal firing to temporally restrict circadian behavior to appropriate time windows in \nSCN molecular clocks. Therefore, we next studied the GABAergic regulation on VIP neurons. \nWe knocked out all three GABAAR subunit β genes (Gabrb1, 2, 3) via in vivo genome editing by injecting AA V \nvectors expressing gRNAs into the SCN of mice expressing SpCas9 specifically in VIP neurons.

In vivo fiber photometry recording of the circadian Ca2+ rhythm in VIP neurons, \nmeasured via jGCaMP7s, showed that the duration of high Ca2+ during subjective daytime were prolonged in Vip-\nGABAAR-/- mice. To directly examine the GABAergic control of VIP neurons by A VP neurons, we measured the \nCa2+ response of VIP neurons to the optogenetic activation of A VP neurons in slices, by expressing ChrimsonR in \nA VP neurons and jGCaMP7s in VIP neurons. Optogenetic activation of A VP neurons transiently increased Ca2+ in \nVIP neurons, which was attenuated in the presence of GABA AR antagonist gabazine.  Intriguingly, gabazine \napplication alone increased VIP neuronal Ca2+. In addition, by expressing jGCaMP7s in non-A VP neurons, we found \ncells in the intermediate region between A VP-rich and VIP-rich areas that responded to AVP neuronal activation by \nreducing Ca2+. \nThese results suggest that VIP neurons receive tonic inhibition by surrounding GABAergic neurons and that \nGABA released from A VP neurons disinhibits VIP neurons indirectly via other cells, resulting in suppression of \nlocomotor activity.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25050715515187.pdf"}, {"title": "Neuronal feedback loop in the suprachiasmatic nucleus generates robust circadian rhythms", "text": "Neuronal feedback loop in the suprachiasmatic nucleus generates robust\ncircadian rhythms\nMohan Wang1, Yusuke Tsuno1, Yubo Peng1, Ayako Matsui1, Takashi Maejima1, Michihiro Mieda1,*\n1Department of Integrative Neurophysiology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa University,\nKanazawa, Japan\nE-mail: wmh17782505724@163.com\nAbstract: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker in mammals, is a network\nstructure composed of multiple types of GABA neurons, which can be differentiated by the co-expression of\nspecific peptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). We previously\nproposed that AVP neurons in the SCN shell function as the primary oscillating part of the SCN network,\npacesetting the SCN ensemble period and taking charge of the oscillation itself. On the other hand, VIP,\nexpressed in the SCN core, has been considered a critical factor for the circadian rhythmicity and\nsynchronization of individual SCN neurons. However, the precise mechanisms by which VIP regulates SCN\ncircuit remain incompletely understood.\nIn the current study, we investigated the regulation of AVP neuronal circadian oscillation by VIP in vivo.\nBy monitoring cellular calcium rhythms in vivo in VIP-deficient mice, we found that AVP neurons\nintrinsically oscillate with a short period and that VIP amplifies and delays the AVP neuronal rhythm to\nlengthen its period to around 24 hours. VIP and other neurons occasionally exhibited weak, unstable,\nlong-period calcium rhythms only when AVP neuronal oscillation was attenuated. The disruption of\nVIP/VPAC2 signaling in AVP neurons in adulthood acutely shortened the free-running period, suggesting that\nthe intrinsic short period of AVP neuronal clocks manifested in the absence of phase-delaying regulation by\nVIP. Furthermore, the circadian behavior period was lengthened by blocking neurotransmitter release from\nAVP neurons, further confirming thatAVP neurons intrinsically encode a short-period circadian rhythm.\nTogether with our previous finding that AVP neurons act as the primary pacesetter cells of the SCN\nensemble rhythm, our results indicate that the feedback neuronal circuit of AVP cellular oscillator and VIP\npeptide signaling may be the essential network mechanism of the central circadian pacemaker of the SCN to\ngenerate robust circadian rhythms.\nKeywords: suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN); vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP); arginine vasopressin (AVP);\nneuronal feedback loop", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25032412083492.pdf"}, {"title": "ALG1 Correlated with Malignancies and Immune Microenvironment in Gliomas", "text": "ALG1 Correlated with Malignancies and Immune\nMicroenvironment in Gliomas\nShu-xiang LI1,2, Peng GAO1,3,*, Yang XIA1, Xin QIAN1, Jing ZHANG1, Jin-Hai Ma2, Qiang LIU3,\nAn-Hong LIU3\n¹Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular Diseases, Ningxia Medical University,Ningxia Province,\n750004, China\n2Department of Pediatric,General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Ningxia Province,\n750004, China\n3Department of Neurosurgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Ningxia Province,\n750004, China\n*Correspondingauthor\nE-mail:owen6688@126.com\nAbstract: Objective Among the most common types of brain tumor, gliomas are the most\naggressive and have the poorest prognosis.

There, a comprehensive overview of gene and protein expression in the main anatomical structures of the mouse, pig and human brain is provided, by combining in-house generated and publicly available transcriptomic data. Previously, we had generated RNA sequencing data for 967 samples from 193 micro-dissected regions and areas of the human brain and subsequently classified all protein coding genes based on regional distribution and co-expression, thus providing lists of genes associated to brain regions, cell types and functions. As part of that, we had the distribution of >180 astrocyte-specific genes and generated a detailed map of astrocyte genes distribution throughout the adult human brain. Methods Following recent advances in RNA-sequencing technologies, the field of spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful technique for studying single-cell transcriptomes over space and these methods have provided valuable tools for mapping the spatial distribution of mRNA transcripts in the brain.

The enrichment of lipid droplets in plaque -associated \nmicroglia (PAM) is considered a significant pathological feature of AD, yet the specific mechanisms \nand functional implications of cellular lipid metabolism are still unclear. This study reveals that \nimpaired cholesterol efflux in PAM directly drives lipid droplet accumulation, a process closely \nlinked to the membrane expression regulation of ABCA1. In PAM, lysosomal expression of ABCA1 \nincreases, leading to cholesterol efflux impairment and lipid droplet accumulation. VPS35 plays a \ncentral regulatory role in this process: VPS35 agonists promote ABCA1 membrane expression,  \nenhance cholesterol efflux, and reduce lipid droplet accumulation in microglia; conversely, VPS35 \nknockout results in decreased ABCA1 membrane expression and significant intracellular \naccumulation of cholesterol and lipid droplets. Further research shows that PAM with lipid droplet \naccumulation exhibit reduced ability to internalize and degrade A β, indicating functional \nimpairment. Additionally, intermittent hypoxia training upregulates VPS35 expression, alleviates \ncholesterol accumulation and lipid droplet enrichment in PAM, and improves cognitive function in \nmice. However, this protective effect disappears after microglial VPS35 knockout. This study is the \nfirst to reveal the mechanism by which impaired cholesterol efflux in PAM drives lipid droplet \naccumulation and elucidates the central role of the VPS35 -ABCA1 axis in regulating microglial \ncholesterol metabolism and lipid droplet formation, providing a new potential therapeutic target for \nAlzheimer's disease. \nKeywords: Alzheimer's disease; microglia, lipid droplets; cholesterol metabolism; VPS35; \nABCA1; intermittent hypoxia training", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051218542219.pdf"}, {"title": "MFN2 Improves Glioblastoma Prognosis by Modulating the Immune-Suppressive Microenvironment through M2 Macrophages and PD-L1", "text": "MFN2 Improves Glioblastoma Prognosis by Modulating the \nImmune-Suppressive Microenvironment through M2 \nMacrophages and PD-L1 \n \nYang Xia¹ , Shu-xiang Li² , An-hong Liu1, Xin Qian1, Peng Gao*1, Jing Zhang1 \n \n¹ Department of Neurosurgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Ningxia Province, \n750004, China \n² Department of Pediatric,General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Ningxia Province, \n750004, China \n \n*Corresponding author \n \nE-mail:owen6688@126.com \n \nAbstract：Objective Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumor that remains difficult \nto treat, with poor prognosis.

AQP4 also contributes to the glymphatic system, which\tfacilitates the clearance of metabolic waste from the brain. Recently, several studies have suggested that AQP4 is critically involved in the development and recovery of ischemic stroke. For instance, Monai et al. found that pan-adrenergic receptor (AdR) antagonists may aid recovery from acute ischemic stroke by preserving AQP4 expression and polarization in mice. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which AdR signaling activation influences AQP4 polarization remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that β-AdR activation affects AQP4 polarization through microglial activation, as microglia are known to express abundant β-AdRs. Methods β-AdR agonists were locally administered to the cortex of anesthetized mice to evaluate their effects on microglial activation and AQP4 polarization. To further examine the involvement of microglia, minocycline, a known microglial inhibitor, was used to assess whether it could mitigate β-AdR-induced AQP4 dysregulation. Results (1) Local administration of β-AdR agonists induced microglial activation and resulted in AQP4 dysregulation. (2) β-AdR agonists modulated microglial activity. (3) Treatment with minocycline alleviated the β-AdR-induced AQP4 dysregulation. Conclusion Microglial activation plays a significant role in β-AdR-induced alterations in AQP4 localization.

In cases of painful diabetic polyneuropathy, postmortem analysis of dorsal root ganglia \n(DRG) from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy showed upregulation of both C5a receptors \n(C5aR1 and C5aR2)1. Since the precursor of C5a (C5) is primarily produced in the liver, C5a \nmay also be present in the blood. Our study aimed to assess whether male and female mice \nexhibit similar patterns of C5a plasma concentration and C5 expression in the liver over time. \nAdditionally, we collected dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from both sexes and compared the \nreceptor expression in male and female mice. \nMethods: Neuropathic pain in wild -type (WT) male and female mice was induced using the \nchronic constriction injury ( CCI) model and sham mice had the same surgical procedure but \nwithout loose ligatures around the sciatic nerve. V on Frey filaments were used to measure paw \nwithdrawal thresholds (PWTs) in the ipsilateral (injured side) hindpaws of CCI -mice. Plasma \nsamples were collected on days 0, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post -CCI surgery. DRGs was collected \non days 4, 7, 14 and 28, and liver tissue was collected on days 4, 7, and 28 post CCI -surgery. \nLumbar DRG C5aR1 receptor expression was assessed using immunohistochemical (IHC) \nanalysis, plasma C5a concentrations were measured by ELISA, and liver C5 expression was \nassessed by qPCR. \nResults: There was a significant increase in the plasma concentration of C5a for all female \nCCI-mice in comparison to the corresponding sham -group of mice. Additionally, there was a \nfurther significant increase in the plasma C5a concentrations from day 4 to day 7 i n female \nCCI-mice.  Thereafter, the plasma C5a concentrations remained relatively stable until day 28 \nafter CCI-surgery in female mice. Interestingly, in the male mice, there were no significant \ndifferences in the C5a plasma concentrations between the sham-group and that of the CCI-mice \nassessed on days 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after CCI surgery. Additionally, these plasma \nconcentrations in male mice were very low (< 4 ng/mL) in contrast to the 40 -50-fold higher \nplasma C5a concentrations observed in the femal e mice in the 7 -28 day period post -CCI \nsurgery. The liver expression of C5 was in accordance with the ELISA results. There were \nincreased mRNA expression levels of C5 in female mice from day 4 after CCI surgery, whereas \nin male groups C5 mRNA expression le vels remained low until study completion on day 28 \nafter CCI -surgery. However, there were no significant differences in DRG fluorescence \nintensity for C5aR1 between male and female mice in sections of lumbar DRGs.  \nConclusions: There is evidence of sexual dimorphism in C5a plasma concentrations in a \nwidely used mouse model of neuropathic pain. Recognising the similar levels in DRG C5aR1 \nexpression for both sexes, the differences in C5a plasma concentrations may be linked to sex -\nrelated differences in immune and glial cell activation, but future investigation is required.  \nReference: \n1.

Abstract: Objective Shifting microglia to M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype is crucial for spinal cord injury (SCI). Human hair-extracted keratin exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. However, the differences among their 17 subtypes and mechanisms of anti-inflammation remain unclear. This study explored the anti-inflammatory activity of 17 recombinant keratins (RKs) and the structure-function relationship of RK33A. Methods Distinct inflammatory modulation of 17 RKs was measured through qPCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. RK33A nanofiber (RKNF) is fabricated to evaluate its anti-inflammatory and nerve regeneration properties in rat T9 hemisection SCI model. The intrinsic mechanism of RK33A regulating M2 polarization was verified by RNA-seq analysis. Different α-helix segments (1Aα, 1Bα, and 2α) of RK33A were designed to assess anti-inflammatory activity. Results (1) RK33A displays superior anti-inflammatory efficiency compared to other keratins. (2) RKNF33A enhances M2 polarization, promotes nerve regeneration, and improves function recovery in SCI rats. (3) RK33A regulates M2 polarization by competing with Icam-1 to interact with Lfa-1, then inhibiting Jak3/Stat5 pathway. (4) RK33A-2α displays the strongest anti-inflammatory effects. (5) RKNF33A-2α exerts superior beneficial effects in the SCI rats. Conclusion Keratins exhibit distinct anti-inflammatory properties, providing a prospective treatment for SCI. This study validates the feasibility of high-efficiency anti-inflammatory agent design through intrinsic mechanisms and structure-function relationships, offering a theoretical basis for advanced biomaterials and treatment in SCI therapy.

Its\npathogenesis is complex, involving genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and immune\ndysregulation. Although traditional transcriptomic approaches have provided valuable insights\ninto disease mechanisms, the precise composition and functional states of immune cells within\ndifferent lesion regions remain incompletely understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing\n(scRNA-seq), an emerging technology that enables the resolution of cellular heterogeneity at the\nsingle-cell level, overcomes the limitations of bulk RNA-seq and has become a powerful tool for\ninvestigating the pathogenesis of MS. Methods: In this study, we reanalyzed published single-cell\nRNA-seq datasets from various MS lesion regions, including lesion core, perilesional areas,\nchronic active lesions, inactive lesions, and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). We\nsystematically characterized the cellular heterogeneity and dynamic functional states of immune\ncells across these spatially distinct regions. Results: We constructed a comprehensive immune\ncell atlas across different MS lesion stages and spatial locations. Immune cells were\npredominantly enriched in lesion core and chronic active lesion regions. Unsupervised clustering\nidentified 11 immune cell subpopulations. Among them, clusters 0 and 3 were enriched in NAWM\nand were mainly involved in homeostatic maintenance, glial migration, and synaptic pruning.\nClusters 1 and 7 were enriched in perilesional areas, associated with vascular permeability, cell\nadhesion, and responses to external stimuli. In inactive lesions, clusters 2 and 6 dominated, with\nfunctions related to antigen presentation, tissue remodeling, and metabolic regulation. Chronic\nactive lesions exhibited increased proportions of nearly all immune subpopulations, with functions\nincluding immune homeostasis, myelin phagocytosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis. Notably,\nopposing functional immune clusters coexisted in chronic active lesions, suggesting a complex\nmicroenvironment involving both inflammatory and reparative processes. In lesion core regions,\nclusters 4 and 5 were prominent, associated with synapse assembly and response to toxic stimuli.\nFurthermore, intercellular communication analysis revealed that chemokines, cytokines, and\nligand-receptor interactions may play key roles in lesion evolution. Trajectory analysis indicated a\ncontinuous functional transition of immune cells from pro-inflammatory to reparative phenotypes,\nwith chronic active lesions representing an intermediate transitional state, offering novel insights\ninto the dynamic immune landscape of MS.

This\nsegregation creates two major bottlenecks: (1) A temporal gap of hours to days exists between\nspatial transcriptomic data and electrophysiological events, making it difficult to capture transient\nmolecular dynamics during seizures; and (2) The resolution of current technologies (e.g.,\n~100-200µm for standard spatial transcriptomics) is insufficient to match the micron-scale\nelectrophysiological hotspots identified by microelectrode arrays (MEAs), limiting the analysis of\nlocal effects by microglial subpopulations. For instance, while expression of the complement\ncomponent C3 in microglia is implicated in synaptic engulfment, its potential spatiotemporal\ncorrelation with specific electrophysiological signatures like γ-oscillations or high-frequency\noscillations (HFOs) remains elusive. Methods Addressing these challenges, this study proposes an\ninnovative ​ ​ \"intraoperative multimodal closed-loop integration\"​ ​ approach. By precisely\naligning millisecond-resolution electrophysiological recordings from 128-channel MEAs with\nreal-time 10x Visium spatial transcriptomic data, we aim to dynamically correlate discharge events\nwith molecular expression in human epileptic tissue.

Finally, we will develop GliaPredict, a machine learning-based risk-prediction model,\nintegrating intraoperative electrophysiological and morphological data to forecast post-surgical\nrecurrence risk.

Microglia and infiltrated macrophages are the major scavenger of debris in\nstroke lesion. However, as stroke progresses, their phagocytic capacity is impaired, while\nsecretion of pro-inflammatory factors was enhanced. This study aims to identify the mechanisms\ndriving the phenotypic shift after excessive phagocytosis. Methods Brain cells from 8-12\nweek-old male C57BL/6J mice were collected for single-cell RNA sequencing at 1, 5, and 14 days\nafter transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), as well as from sham-operated control\ngroup. Key transcription factors mediating the phenotypic changes of microglia and macrophages\nwere identified through bioinformatics analysis, and further validated in vivo and in vitro using\nimmunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and Western blot. Additionally, tMCAO models\nwere treated with the key factor inhibitor to evaluate microglia and macrophage phenotypic shifts\nand the progression of stroke. Results Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we\nidentified a concurrent activation pattern between the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)\nmediated Type I interferon signaling and the pro-inflammatory phenotype of\nmicroglia/macrophages. In the first 5 days after stroke, microglia and macrophages displayed an\ninflammatory-resolving phenotype with enhanced phagocytic activity, but from days 5 to 14, they\ntransitioned to a pro-inflammatory phenotype with sustained upregulation of STING-mediated\nType I interferon pathway molecules. We validated the phenomenon observed in bioinformatics\nusing tMCAO models. In vitro and in vivo, we found that continuous phagocytosis by\nmacrophages and microglia led to STING activation, triggering Type I interferon signaling and\ndriving the phenotypic shift towards a pro-inflammatory state. Treatment with STING inhibitor\nH-151 reversed these detrimental shifts. Conclusions These findings suggest that continuous\npost-stroke phagocytosis by macrophages and microglia led to the activation of STING, thereby\ntriggering type I interferon signaling and driving the phenotypic shift towards a pro-inflammatory\nstate.

However, the mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain poorly\nunderstood. While evidence suggests acupuncture may act via the nervous system, limitations in\nmacroscopic, whole-brain imaging techniques have hindered progress. This study employs\nfunctional ultrasound imaging (fUS), a novel technology compatible with electroacupuncture and\ncapable of whole-brain functional imaging in awake or sedated small animals, to investigate\ncerebral functional changes during electroacupuncture stimulation at ST36 (Zusanli) in mice.\nMethods: Electroacupuncture stimulation at ST36 was performed in mice under two sedation\nprotocols: medetomidine alone and dexmedetomidine combined with Zoletil. Sham stimulation\n(non-acupoint) was used to assess acupoint specificity. Concurrent fUS scans were conducted to\nmonitor brain activity. Results: Under medetomidine sedation, ST36 stimulation induced robust\nand sustained activation of the hypothalamus and pallidum. In mice sedated with\ndexmedetomidine-Zoletil, stimulation additionally activated the prefrontal cortex. Sham\nstimulation elicited no significant activation in these regions.

Mitochondrial transplantation to renew the mitochondrial pools of the\ninjured neurons is a promising therapeutic strategy. Migrasomes, newly discovered cellular\norganelles, are specific membrane vesicles released extracellularly during cell migration. Here, we\nidentified exercise-induced migrasomes derived from skeletal muscle, which carry mitochondria\nand protect neurons against ischemic damage. The present study aims to explore the potential of\nmitochondrial transplantation to neurons as a therapeutic approach. Methods The gene expression\npatterns of mitochondrial-related genes were analyzed across different tissues. Wild-type\nC57BL/6J mice (8-10 weeks old, both male and female) underwent treadmill training.\nExercise-derived migrasomes from plasma and skeletal muscle were examined using transmission\nelectron microscopy, 4D-DIA quantitative proteomics, and untargeted metabolomics. Mice were\nsubjected to 60 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) with or without exercise\ntraining or exercise migrasome treatment. Results We discovered that although incapable of\ncanonical cellular migration, skeletal muscle (SKM) fibers produce migrasomes during\ncontraction, which induces intercellular relative displacement.

Specifically, we hypothesize tha t reduced \nMRPS12 expression in PFC neurons leads to metabolic and functional abnormalities, subsequently \naffecting depression -related neural circuit transmission.  Methods The study employs a multi -\nfaceted approach combining in vitro and in vivo methodologies. In vitro experiments will involve \nmanipulating MRPS12 expression in primary cultured mouse PFC neurons using viral vectors and \ngene editing techniques, followed by comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial function, \nneuronal morphology, cell viability, and global gene and protein expression via RNA -Seq and \nproteomics. In vivo  studies will utilize established mouse models of depression to examine \nendogenous MRPS12 expression levels.  Results Preliminary analysis of single -cell RNA \nsequencing data from the postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of suicide victims with MDD \nrevealed that MRPS12 is primarily localized in neurons and endothelial cells. Compared to controls, \nMRPS12 expression was significantly reduced in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of MDD \npatients. Further experiments demonstrated that in chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) depressive \nmice, both MRPS12 mRNA and protein expression were significantly downregulated in the \nprefrontal cortex. Neuronal-specific knockdown of MRPS12 in the cortex resulted in a significant \ndecrease in the number of neuronal dendrites and induced typical depressive-like behaviors in mice. \nIn primary cultured mouse cortical neurons, shRNA-mediated knockdown of MRPS12 significantly \ninhibited mitochondrial function, decreasing mtDNA contents, mitochondrial membrane potential, \nmitochondrial complex I activity, and ATP production, while also causing ROS production and \noxidative injury.

Methods This study included\nresting-state functional MRI data from 838 MDD patients and 881 healthy controls (HC)\nacross 23 sites. We applied novel edge-centric connectome model to estimate edge functional\nconnectivity and identify overlapping network communities. Regional functional diversity was\nquantified via normalized entropy based on community overlap patterns. Neurobiological\ndecoding was performed to map brain-wide relationships between functional diversity\nalterations and patterns of gene expression and neurotransmitter distribution. Comparative\nmachine learning analyses further evaluated the diagnostic utility of edge-centric versus node-\ncentric connectome representations. Results Compared with HC, MDD patients exhibited\nsignificantly increased functional diversity within the prefrontal-striatal-thalamic reward\ncircuit.

This behavior, which involves the deliberate\ndestruction of body tissue without suicidal intent, is frequently linked to blunted pain\nperception and addictive actions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these\nsymptoms remain poorly understood. Methods Resting-state high-density\nelectroencephalography (hd-EEG) data were recorded from 101 NSSI adolescents (14.33±\n1.48 years, 16 males /85 females) and 70 healthy controls (HC) (14.50±1.49 years, 15\nmales /55 females), and source-localized to assess functional connectivity (FC) patterns\nacross brain regions based on oscillatory activities. The Ottawa Self-Harm Inventory's item\n21 was used to assess pain sensitivity during self-injury, while item 22 was used to evaluate\naddictive behaviors associated with self-injury. Results (1) Compared to HC, NSSI\nadolescents exhibited overall increases in FC across all four frequency band oscillations,\nwith the most significantly changes in theta and beta oscillations. It is worth to\nmentioning that almost significant change in beta FC involving the default mode\nnetwork (DMN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), and limbic network (LN), while regions\nfrom all networks were broadly involved alterations in other oscillation. (2) Low and\nhigh pain sensitivity subtype based on pain sensitivity score were defined. We found\nthat the difference between the two subtypes and HC was only significant in the alpha\nband, with high pain sensitivity subtype showing higher alpha FCs in most connectivity\nthan HC, whereas low pain sensitivity subtype showed little change in the alpha FC. (3)\nNSSI was also divided into addition and non-addiction subtype according to addiction\nscore. Compared to non-addiction subtype, addiction subtype showed remarkable\nchange in theta FCs. Discussion Significant changes in brain activity patterns were\nrecovered in patients with NSSI. The significant elevations in alpha FC may be\nspecifically associated with abnormal pain perception function and may result from\nabnormalities in networks related to attention and emotion. In contrast, elevated theta\nFC is associated with addictive behavior in NSSI.

In the 16p11.2 deletion mouse model, which mimics a common copy number variation \nassociated with ASDs, we previously demonstrated delayed motor learning alongside abnormally elevated \nneuronal activity in the primary motor cortex (M1). Remarkably, activating locus coeruleus noradrenergic \n(LC-NA) neurons rescued both circuit deficits and delayed motor learning. In this study, we used in vivo \ntwo-photon microscopy to monitor LC-NA calcium axonal activity during motor learning and identified \nthe temporal of LC-NA activity, in which non-behavioral related 'rapid' axonal activity (sub-second \nduration events) profoundly affect the behavior-induced 'persistent' axonal activity (second duration \nevents).  In addition, we performed two-photon imaging of NA sensor in M1, and we further uncovered \nthat behavior-induced NA release is spatially heterogeneous at the scale of local microcircuitry.

The firing and burst\nrates of VTADA neurons consecutively decreased following PTSD modeling and were\nrestored by early S-ketamine intervention. In particular, VTADA neurons responded to\nthe conditioned stimuli, mediating the replacement of aversive memory encoding\nduring fear extinction. The inhibition of VTADA-OFC interrupted the PTSD treatment\ninduced by S-ketamine.

However, the limited availability of animal and cellular models that accurately replicate early DLB pathogenesis hampers our understanding of how Ab plaques influence α-synuclein (αSyn) pathologies. In this study, we co-cultured primary neurons with adult hippocampal brain slices obtained from wild-type or AD mice containing abundant Ab plaques and cytokines. Our findings revealed a downregulation of the dynein-dependent organelle trafficking pathway in neurons co-cultured with AD slices, which resulted in decreased endosome-lysosome fusion and impaired degradation of amyloidogenic αSyn fibrils. This impairment led to an increase in αSyn inclusions within the neurons. Notably, we observed an abnormal pre-accumulation of dynein in the AD mouse model, indicating that dysfunctional dynein may act as a primary aggregation site for αSyn inclusions when exposed to αSyn fibrils. Moreover, the activation of Rab7 restored endo-lysosomal degradation pathway for αSyn fibrils, thereby reducing the formation of inclusions in mouse models of Lewy body disorders that also exhibited Aβ pathology. These results indicate that targeting the dynein-dependent endo-lysosomal degradation pathway may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing αSyn-related Lewy body disorders associated with Aβ pathology.

So far, the \nprevalence of this disease has been long underestimated. However, there are no specific drugs or \ntreatment strategies available. The main pathological features of CADASIL include the \ndegeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the brain, but the mechanisms \nremain unclear.

Clinically, the \nearly symptoms of AD include memory decline, language disorders, and impaired visuospatial \nabilities. Olfactory dysfunction is also suggested to occur early in AD, potentially linked to neural \ncircuit disruption. The anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) is the first station for olfactory information \nprocessing. AON, located in the olfactory cortex, is the first station for the transmission of olfactory \ninformation. The molecular mechanism by which AON regulates early olfactory dysfunction in AD \nis currently unclear. In this study, behavioral and fiber -optic recording techniques were used to \ndemonstrate that olf actory dysfunction exists in the early stages of AD model mice, and that the \nAON region is involved in the recognition and discrimination of olfactory information during the \nlearning process. The representation of different odors in the AON region is relat ed to the \ncorresponding reward behaviors. When the activity of AON neurons is inhibited, the olfactory \ndiscrimination ability of mice after learning is reduced.  Thus, AON neurons play a role in neural \ncircuits and olfactory memory deficits in AD.  Methods For 3-month-old wild-type and 3 ×FAD \nmice, a circular iron ring was installed on their heads. Optical fiber recordings were used to inject \nthe adeno-associated virus AA V-Syn-GCaMP6s into the AON of mice and to insert optical fibers, \nensuring accurate viral injection and secure fiber fixat ion. Using C57BL/6J male mice as subjects \nfor olfactory discrimination research, chemogenetic techniques are employed to suppress neuronal \nactivity in the AON during the behavioral experiment, investigating the role of this brain region in \nolfactory discrimination. Result (1) 3×FAD mice have a reduced olfactory recognition ability \ncompared to WT mice.  (2) Optical recordings demonstrate the involvement of the  AON in the \nlearning process of olfactory discrimination in mice. (3) Inhibition of AON neuronal activity affects \nmice olfactory discrimination.

The pathogenesis remains unclear. Among Them, Neuroinflammation mediated by\nmicroglia has merged as an involving mechanism at the initiation and development of PD. Our\nprevious research has shown that the expression level of deubiquitinase OTUD3 is reduced in\nA53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice (A53T Tg mice), and with increasing age, OTUD3-/-mice\nexhibit certain motor impairments. However, its role in microglia is still unknown. This study\nfocuses on the interaction between OTUD3 and neuroinflammation in microglia, exploring\nwhether OTUD3 in microglia promotes the occurrence of neuroinflammation mediated by\nmicroglia during the progression of Parkinson's disease, thereby accelerating physiological aging\ninto PD.\nIn this study, we detected the expression levels of OTUD3 and IBA1 in the substantia nigra\nof A53T Tg mice, as well as the expression level of IBA1 in the substantia nigra of OTUD3-/- mice.\nIn addition, we used immunofluorescence to detect the expression of OTUD3 in BV2 cells.\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated BV2 cells was used an in vitro model of neuroinflammation.\nBV2 cells with overexpression and knockdown of OTUD3 were established to elucidate the\nimportance of OTUD3 in LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Our findings found that the expression\nlevel of OTUD3 is decreased and the expression level of IBA1 is increased in A53T Tg mice.\nMoreover, the expression level of IBA1 in the substantia nigra of OTUD3-/- mice increases.\nAdditionally, we found that OTUD3 is expressed in BV2 cells. Stimulation of BV2 cells with LPS\ncan significantly upregulate the expression of inflammatory factors, overexpression of OTUD3\ncan significantly inhibit the expression of these inflammatory factors, while knockdown of\nOTUD3 in microglia can significantly exacerbate the LPS-induced inflammatory response.\nFurthermore，Knockdown of microglia OTUD3 can exacerbate the apoptosis of dopaminergic\nneurons caused by inflammatory damage. Conversely, Overexpression of microglia OTUD3 can\ninhibit the damage of dopamine neurons by microglia under inflammatory conditions.\nThe above results indicate that under the pathological conditions of PD, the decrease of\nOTUD3 in microglia may regulate neuroinflammation, thereby exacerbating the loss of\ndopaminergic neurons induced by it and promoting the occurrence and development of PD.

Over the past two decades, almost all phase III clinical trials \nfor AD therapeutic drugs have failed to meet their predetermined endpoints. Based on the close \ncorrelation between the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and aging caused by age factors, as \nwell as the characteristic manifestations of accelerated neuronal a nd synaptic loss and brain \natrophy during aging, we believe that the treatment of AD should not only focus on symptomatic \ntreatment, but also aim to delay or inhibit neurodegeneration and promote neuronal regeneration. \nTherefore, we innovatively propose the concept of targeting neurogenesis promotion and \nanti-neuronal apoptosis for the treatment of AD, and design and synthesize neuroprotective agents \nbased on Akt activators to improve cognitive dysfunction in AD through Akt activation and \nanti-apoptosis. Methods Based on the active structure of Akt in SC79 and existing neuroprotective \nagents, over 70 small molecule NS derivatives were designed and synthesized. Screening of the \nNS derivatives for promoting neuronal proliferation and anti-neuronal apoptosis was conducted in \nvitro. In vivo  studies were carried out to investigate the effects and related mechanisms of NS \nderivatives in improving cognitive dysfunction in multiple animal models of AD. The deposition \nof Aβ plaques was analyzed using our self-developed Aβ plaque automatic analysis and statistical \nsoftware TD PIA.  Results At the cellular level, our designed NS derivatives can activate the \nexpression of Akt in normal and OGD -injured APP-SK-N, SK-N, and primary cultured neurons, \\npromote cell survival, and reduce apoptosis in OGD -injured APP -SK-N and primary cultured \nneurons. Specifically, the Akt agonist NS2101 promotes cell proliferation and anti -apoptotic \neffects by activating the Akt -GSK3β-CDK-BDNF pathway and inhibiting the P53 -Bax-mTOM \npathway, respectively. In in vivo animal experiments, NS2101 significantly improved cognitive \ndysfunction in multiple behavioral assessment methods, including the water maze test, step -down \ntest, and open field test, in various AD animal models such as APP/PS1 transgenic mice, \nscopolamine intraperitoneally-injected mice, Aβ25-35-injected rats, SAMP8 rapid aging mice, and \n5XFAD transgenic mice. NS2101 also significantly improved LTP impairment in APP/PS1 \ntransgenic mice and Aβ25-35-injected rats. In mechanistic studies, NS2101 improved cognitive \ndysfunction mainly by activating Akt and GSK3β, promoting the expression of CDK6 and BDNF, \nand facilitating neural regeneration; simultaneously, it reduced the expression of P53, Bax, and \nmTOM to decrease neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, NS2101 can also reduce the expression of \npTau protein at the S199 site and B ACE1 protein. Although NS2101 is not targeted at A β, it can \nstill significantly reduce A β plaque deposition in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Pharmaceutical \nstudies have demonstrated that the single -dose LD50 of NS2101 in mice is >800 mg/kg, and no \nsignificant toxic side effects were observed after oral administration at a maximum dose of 320 \nmg/kg for 28 days in dogs. NS2101 has good oral absorption, high plasma concentration, and slow \nmetabolic rate, indicating good pharmaceutical properties.  Conclusion The mechanism of action \nof the small molecule NS2101, which promotes neurogenesis and inhibits apoptosis, differs from \nexisting marketed drugs and drugs in clinical trials both domestically and internationally. Its target \nmechanism is novel, promoting neuroregeneration and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, and reducing \nthe deposition of pathological A β plaques. It significantly improves cognitive function, fully \nverifying that activating Akt and downstream signaling pathways is an effective strategy for \ntreating AD. NS2101 has a novel structure, solid efficacy, and good drug properties.

Logistic regression\nadjusted for patient- and surgery-related confounders, and 1:1 propensity score matching yielded\n44 matched pairs. Results: The overall POD incidence was 40.4% (72/178). Significantly fewer\npatientsexperiencedPOD inthefentanylgroup(6.8%)comparedtothesufentanil group(63.8%).\nAfter full adjustment, fentanyl was strongly associated with lower POD odds (OR 0.017, 95% CI\n0.003–0.070, p=0.017), confirmed by propensity score matching (OR 0.005, 95% CI 0–0.057,\np<0.001) across age, sex, and diabetes subgroups. Conclusions: This study highlights POD's\nburden in perioperative stroke patients and identifies opioid selection as a modifiable risk factor.\nFentanyl use reduces POD risk more than sufentanil, suggesting that opioid choice is crucial for\ndelirium prevention. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and elucidate\nmechanisms.\nKeywords: Delirium,perioperativestroke,fentanyl,sufentanil,opioids", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25060312541984.pdf"}, {"title": "MPTP/6-OHDA-induced abnormalities of iron metabolism in zona incerta of Parkinson's disease model mice", "text": "MPTP/6-OHDA-induced abnormalities of iron metabolism in\nzona incerta of Parkinson's disease model mice\nYanhong Liu, Minxia Xiu, Jing Zhang, Junxia Xie, Limin Shi*\nDepartment of Physiology, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis and Prevention\nof Neurological Disorders, School of Basic Medicine, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.\nInstitute of Brain Science and Disease, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China\n*Corresponding author: Limin Shi\nE-mail address: Liminshi@qdu.edu.cn\nAbstract: Objective Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic\nneurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and abnormal iron metabolism. While most of the current\nstudies have focused on iron deposition within the substantia, there is still limited research into the\nrole of iron in other brain regions. The zona incerta (ZI), a heterogeneous subthalamic region,\npossesses extensive connections with the basal ganglia nucleus and recently emerged as a new\ntherapeutic target for PD. Deep brain stimulation of the ZI has been reported to relieve motor\nsymptoms and experimental heat pain in patients with PD. The aim of the present study is to\nevaluate changes in iron levels in the ZI. Methods Two neurotoxins, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-\ntetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), were used to prepare PD mice.\nAfter MPTP/6-OHDA injection, behavioral changes were detected by gait analysis. Tyrosine\nhydroxylase expression was measured by immunostaining. The number of iron-staining positive\nneurons in the ZI was detected by Perls’ iron staining. The changes of H-Ferritin protein levels in\nZI were detected using western blot. Results Gait analysis showed that mice exhibited postural\ninstability and dyskinesia after MPTP/6-OHDA injection. The numbers of iron-positive cells were\nsignificantly increased in the SN and ZI of MPTP/6-OHDA-treated mice compared with the\ncontrol group. Furthermore, the expression of H-Ferritin was increased. DMT1 expression levels\nwere also significantly increased in the ZI of MPTP/6-OHDA-treated mice compared to the\ncontrol. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a marker of ferroptosis, was also detected. Western\nblots revealed that MPTP significantly down-regulated the level of GPX4 in the ZI. Conclusion In\nthis study, we determined that increased iron levels may be present in the ZI in PD mice.\nKeywords: Parkinson’s disease; MPTP; 6-OHDA; Zona incerta; Gait analysis; Iron staining", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051421181098.pdf"}, {"title": "ALDOA-Induced Glycolysis Exacerbates Motor Neuron Pyroptosis and Accelerates ALS Progression", "text": "ALDOA-Induced Glycolysis Exacerbates Motor Neuron\nPyroptosis and Accelerates ALS Progression\nYan Kaixin1, Zhou Jinxia2, Zhang Tianshuo2, Li Jiayi2, Pi Shanyu2, Zeng Qianqian3, Zhang Nian\nnian3, Liu Yongmin2，* , Bi Fangfang2，*\n1.Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University,\nUrumqi 831500, China\n2.Department of Neurology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai\n519000, China\n3.Department of Neurology, Xiangya Hospital, Changsha 410000, China\n*Corresponding authors\nEmail: biff3@mail.sysu.edu.cn; 335980327@qq.com\nAbstract ： Objective ALS is a fatal neurological disorder characterized by motor neuron\ndegeneration. Its pathogenesis remains unclear, but glycolytic dysregulation is increasingly\nrecognized as a contributor to neurodegenerative disease progression. This study investigates how\nALDOA drives ALS progression through glycolysis-mediated motor neuron pyroptosis. Methods\nIn vivo experiments were conducted using Tardbpflox/flox Map2-CreERT2 mice with\ntamoxifen-induced neuron-specific TDP-43 knockout. Motor function was assessed via rotarod\nand suspension tests. L-lactic acid levels in the motor cortex were measured, and RT-PCR and\nWestern blot analyses were performed to evaluate ALDOA expression and NLRP3/GSDMD\ninflammasome activation. TDP-43 cKO mice were treated with the ALDOA inhibitor\nAldometanib and assessed for the above metrics. In vitro studies utilized TDP-3 knockout NSC34\nmotor neuron-like cells. Cell viability, glucose uptake, and L-lactic acid levels were measured.\nResults ALS model mice exhibited significant motor deficits, progressive weight loss, and\nreduced survival. Their motor cortex showed elevated ALDOA expression, L-lactic acid\naccumulation, and NLRP3/GSDMD inflammasome activation. Aldometanib treatment suppressed\nglycolysis, prolonged survival, and slowed disease progression by inhibiting\nNLRP3/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. In vitro, TDP-43-deficient NSC34 cells displayed\nincreased ALDOA levels, enhanced glycolytic flux, NLRP3/GSDMD pathway activation, and\nimpaired proliferation.

There is also no good clinical treatment to improve \ncognitive decline in CTE. One study has shown that ferroptosis occurs after rm-TBI. However, the \nmechanism underlying the occurrence of ferroptosis and cognitive decline in CTE remains unclear. \nHere we report that the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in the pathological process \nof ferroptosis in neurons a nd cognitive decline in CTE.  Methods Molecular simulations were \nperformed to predict the binding site of the endocannabinoid AEA with ACSL4. Using SPR, it was \ndiscovered that the endocannabinoid AEA can bind to the ACSL4 protein. Point mutations were \nused to evaluate the binding of the endoca nnabinoid AEA with ACSL4 and its role in mitigating \nferroptosis in cultured neurons in vitro. Furthermore, a mouse model of CTE assesses neuronal \nferroptosis and cognitive function. Results Surface plasmon resonance technology (SPR) and point \nmutation experiments have shown that AEA can bind directly to and functions with Serine (Ser) at \nposition 447 of Acyl -CoA synthetase long -chain family member 4 (ACSL4). The binding of \nendocannabinoid AEA to Ser447 at ACSL4 reduces neuronal ferroptosis.

Methods\nSixty rats were randomly divided into six groups: normal controls (WT), Sham\noperation group (S), model group (SCI), TMP group (SCI-T), TMP ＋ Exosome\ninhibitor group (SCI-TEi), and methylprednisolone (MP) group (SCI-M, positive\ncontrol). The SCI model was established using the clamp injury method. Tissue was\ncollected on days 7 and 28 post-operation. These approaches - the\nBasso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale, immunostaining, immunofluorescence staining,\nand transmission electron microscopy imaging - were applied. Motor function, spinal\ncord histopathology, mitochondrial ultrastructure and polarization of microglia in the\ninjured area were examined. Meanwhile, rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells\n(BMSCs) were cultured in vitro to complete exosome extraction and\nimmunofluorescence staining. Inflammatory factors, exosome marker and BV2\nmicroglia polarization of were quantified. Exosomal miRNA high-throughput\nsequencing was performed.

In vivo, TMP markedly improved hindlimb motor function in SCI rats,\ndecreased pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6 or TNF-α), and increased the\nanti-inflammatory factor IL-10, thereby ameliorating post-SCI spinal cord pathology.\nConclusion TMP may regulate the secretion of miRNA-enriched exosomes by\nBMSCs, mediate BMSC- microglia communication, and promote microglia\npolarization toward to the M2 phenotype while inhibiting M1 polarization.

Ascl1 is a transcription\nfactor that regulates photoreceptor development and exhibits anti-apoptotic effects in cancer. This\nstudy investigates the neuroprotective potential of Ascl1 in a mouse model of AMD and explores its\nunderlying mechanisms. Methods: We established a blue light-induced retinal injury model to\nmimic AMD, and overexpressed Ascl1 via subretinal injection of AAV under the CAG promoter.\nRetinal function and structural integrity were assessed using immunofluorescence staining, Western\nblotting (WB), electroretinography (ERG), and visual behavioral tests. Mechanistic insights were\nobtained through TUNEL staining, qPCR, WB, and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Results:\nBlue light exposure induced retinal degeneration, marked by photoreceptor loss, bipolar cell\nreduction, axon shortening, and Müller cell/microglial activation. Ascl1 overexpression enhanced\nphotoreceptor survival, preserved outer segment morphology, improved visual behavior, and\nincreased ERG b-wave amplitude. Ascl1 also repaired the structure of injured RPE. Mechanistically,\nAscl1 reduced TUNEL-positive photoreceptors, suppressed glial activation, downregulated\nCaspase-8 and BAX, and upregulated Bcl2.

We\ninvestigated whether white matter hyperintensities (WMH), a common MRI marker of\ncerebrovascular factors, modulates the effects of β-Amyloid, Tau and α-Syn on brain specific\nregional metabolism in probable DLB and PDD patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study\nenrolled 76 LBD patients (39 probable DLB and 37 PDD) and 35 cognitively normal controls. All\nsubjects underwent FDG-PET, MRI, and CSF biomarker analysis (Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, p-tau, t-tau,\nα-syn). Metabolic patterns were compared using voxel-wise analyses. CSF biomarkers,\n18F-FDG-PET metabolic patterns, and WMH volume were analyzed. Linear regression with\ninteraction component assessed associations among CSF biomarkers, regional FDG-PET\nstandardized uptake value ratio, and WMH volume, adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk\nfactors. Results: The DLB patients exhibited widespread hypometabolism in the parieto-occipital\ncortex extending into temporal lobes and frontal lobe, whereas PDD patients showed focal\nhypometabolism in angular gyrus, caudate and thalamus. Elevated CSF α-syn in probable DLB\ncorrelated with the cuneus and pericalcarine cortex (p-values < 0.05) hypometabolism in the left\nposterior cerebral artery (L-PCA) territory, modified by WMH volume (FDR interaction p-values\n< 0.05). In PDD, higher t-tau were associated with hypometabolism in fusiform and inferior\ntemporal cortex (p-values < 0.05), moderated by WMH volume (FDR interaction p-values < 0.05).\nLower Aβ1-42 were associated with hypometabolism in middle temporal and rostral middle\nfrontal cortex (p-values < 0.05), and WMH exacerbated these relationships (FDR interaction\np-values < 0.05).

Abstract: Objective: To investigate whether electroacupuncture preconditioning (EP) protects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by modulating the SCFAs/GPR43/IL-10 pathway via the brain-gut axis. Methods: Rats were divided into sham (S-con), model (M-con), and EP groups. EP was administered at GV20 and ST36 for 30 min/day over six days. Neurological deficits were assessed using mNSS, adhesive removal, and screen tests. Gut microbiota (16S rRNA sequencing), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, targeted metabolomics), inflammatory markers (ELISA/Western blot), and barrier integrity (tight junction proteins) were analyzed. Results: EP reduced infarct volume, improved neurobehavioral outcomes, and restored gut microbiota balance (alpha diversity, altered composition). SCFAs (butyric, caproic, isobutyric acids) increased. EP lowered pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17) while elevating anti-inflammatory IL-10 and regulatory proteins (Foxp3, GPR43). It also preserved blood-brain and gut barriers (occludin, claudin-1, MUC2).

In particular, antibody drugs approved in \nrecent years have failed to meet clinical needs due to significant issues with efficacy and side \neffects, leading to controversy in clinical use. Clinical trials of anti -AD drugs targeting other \ntraditional targets, such as Aβ and Tau protein, have struggled to reach their endpoints. There is an \nurgent need to re-examine the essence of AD pathogenesis, design novel targets, and develop new \ndrugs. To this end, we conducted a study on the ultrastructure of the whole brain in AD animal \nmodels, aiming to uncover pathological changes at the cellular and molecular levels, explore new \nmechanisms of AD pathogenesis, establish new targets, and serve the design and development of \nnew drugs. Methods Selecting APP/PS1 Tg mice as the research subject, AA V virus was injected \ninto the tail vein to label neurons. Before animal sacrifice, tomato lectin was perfused to label \nmicrovessels. The brain was fixed and imaged using fMOST, a fluorescence micro -optical \nsectioning tomography, as well as transparent light sheet imaging to observe the fine structure of \nbrain tissue. Software such as ImageJ and Imaris were used to process and obtain 2D and 3D \nimages of the whole brain and different brain regions. The Mouse Brain atlas was used for image \nregistration to obtain standard brain regions.  Results Brain images of APP/PS1  Tg mice at 7 and \n12 months of age were acquired using frontal plane sectioning (fMOST) with a resolution of 2 μm \nper section. Approximately 5000 sections were collected from the olfactory bulb to the cerebellum \nfor each mouse brain. To facilitate the observation of complete cells, synapses, and blood vessels, \ndata was processed with every 50 sections (100 μm) integrated into a single three -dimensional \\nimage (projection). In the brains of APP/PS1 Tg mice, a decrease in the number of neurons was \nobserved from the olfactory bulb to the cerebral cortex, and further to the hippocampus, \nparticularly in the number of synapses. Simultaneously, significant aggregation of Aβ plaques and \nplaques containing necrotic neurons and axonal necrosis were also visible. The most pronounced \npathological changes occurred in the hippocampus, where neurons in the CA1 region showed \nsignificant atrophy and loss, with almost all axons connected to them disappearing. Cells and \nnerve fibers in the Mol and Lmol regions were almost nonexistent, the granule cell layer in the DG \nregion was significantly damaged, and significant changes in neuronal morphology and number \nwere observed in the GrDG region. Quantitative calculations were performed on the diameter and \nnumber per unit volume of neurons within each brain region, demonstrating that the hippocampus \nwas the brain region most severely affected by AD and Aβ plaque aggregation, within the mol and \nlmol regions and the granule cell layer suffering the most severe damage.  Conclusion The \nultrastructural pathological changes in the brain regions of APP/PS1 Tg mice are crucial for \nunderstanding the cellular and molecular pathological changes in human Alzheimer's disease, as \nwell as the brain structural basis of cognitive decline. Reducing the loss of nerve fibers in the \nhippocampus and protecting the good structure of the dentate gyrus (DG) region, especially the \nintegrity of the granule cell layer, should be an important goal in the treatment of AD. At the same \ntime, it can also serve as an evaluation index for anti -AD treatment and an objective criterion for \nscreening and discovering innovative drugs for the treatment of AD. \nKeywords: Alzheimer's disease; APP/PS1; fMOST; brain atlas; ultrastructure; Aβ; nerve fiber", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25073009481787.pdf"}, {"title": "Association of vitamin B2 intake with cognitive performance in older adults: a cross-sectional study", "text": "Association of vitamin B2 intake with cognitive performance in older \nadults: a cross-sectional study \n \nLingyan Zhou1,* \n \n1Department of Neurology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical \nUniversity, Jinan, Shandong, China. \n \n*Corresponding author \n \nE-mail: zly2020@whu.edu.cn  \n \nAbstract: Background To scrutinize the relationship be tween vitamin B2 consumption and \ncognitive function based on the NHANES database.

However, a unique microglial subset called lipid droplet accumulating microglia (LDAM) in AD was ignored. Methods: We developed a novel blood-based, non-ATN biomarker assay for AD that measures the average number of lipid droplet(LDs) accumulated in microglia induced by patients' plasma. We evaluated the assay’s performance for classifying AD and indicating AD-related endophenotypes in two independent cohorts from Chinese populations. Results: We identified the increased number of LDs in AD plasma. The assay accurately classified AD (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.813) and also indicating brain amyloid pathology. Moreover, Increased Avg number of LDs level was associated with higher cognitive impairment risk (per SD increment hazard ratio [HR]; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.910; 95% CI 1.612~5.253; P-trend< 0.001).Conclusion: This study demonstrated the utility of a blood-based, nonATN-pathway biomarker assay for early screening and staging of AD, providing insights for patient stratification and precision medicine.", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051521563366.pdf"}, {"title": "The Safety and Efficacy of Gamma Frequency Auditory and Visual Stimulation in the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis", "text": "The Safety and Efficacy of Gamma Frequency Auditory and Visual Stimulation in the\nTreatment of Alzheimer’s Disease:A systematic review and meta-analysis\nShaojiaAng1,2,3,5, Xinyue Zhang1,2, Kaiyao Xue1,2, Jianhong Li1,Yao Gao1,2, XiaoWang1,2, Xinrong Li1, Bo Chen4,\nJihuiZhang4,ShaLiu1,2*\n1DepartmentofPsychiatry,FirstHospital/FirstClinicalMedicalCollegeofShanxiMedicalUniversity,Taiyuan,\nShanxi030001,China\n2 Shanxi Key Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Diagnosis and Treatment for Mental Disorder, First\nHospitalofShanxiMedicalUniversity,Taiyuan,Shanxi030001,China\n3BasicMedicineCollegeofShanxiMedicalUniversity,Taiyuan,Shanxi030001,China\n4DepartmentofPsychiatry,SinopharmNorthHospital,Baotou,China\n5DepartmentofPhysiology,AcademyofMedicalSciences, ShanxiMedicalUniversity,Taiyuan,Shanxi030001,\nChina\n*Correspondence:\nPhD.ShaLiu,DepartmentofPsychiatry,FirstHospitalofShanxiMedicalUniversity,NO.85JiefangNanRoad,\nTaiyuan,China.030000..E-mail:,1109396246@qq.com/(liusha1984114@163.com).Tel:\n15155918243/(15803400167)\nAbstract\nBackground:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline,\nwithasignificantglobalhealthburden.Currentpharmacological treatmentsprovidelimited benefits, underscoring\nthe need for novel therapeutic approaches.

Methods (1) Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided\ninto a control group and a depression model group. The latter underwent 6-week chronic\nunpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated using sucrose\npreference, open field, and forced swim tests.

Early identification of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is essential for timely therapeutic intervention and effective monitoring of disease-modifying strategies. In this study, we introduce a novel analytical framework to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers associated with early cognitive dysfunction, utilizing two complementary murine models: the socially submissive (Sub) Sabra mouse, which exhibits early-onset cognitive deficits and synaptic plasticity impairments, and the transgenic 5xFAD mouse model, characterized by accelerated amyloid pathology and progressive cognitive decline. Methods. To investigate electrophysiological correlates of disease progression, we conducted longitudinal EEG recordings from freely moving animals at 3, 6, and 9 months of age. Recordings were obtained from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), visual cortex (VC), and hippocampal regions in Sub and 5xFAD mice, along with their respective controls—socially dominant (Dom) Sabra mice and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Results: In Sub mice, we observed the following: (A) absence of theta-driven directional connectivity in the VC and enhanced Granger causality from the right VC to PPC during cognitive tasks; (B) reduced theta–gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the VC and PFC; and (C) decreased beta and gamma power in both the PFC and VC. In the 5xFAD model, we identified several key alterations relative to WT controls: (A) reduced signal energy in hippocampal EEG activity; (B) a consistent π-phase shift across theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands (1–100 Hz); (C) altered PAC dynamics in the hippocampus and PFC; (D) increased amplitude fluctuations in the alpha and delta bands; (E) a marked shift toward low-frequency dominance; and (F) evidence of reduced cortical excitability and functional connectivity. To comprehensively characterize these EEG signatures, we employed a suite of advanced signal processing methods, including power spectral density estimation, Hilbert spectrum transformation, principal and independent component analysis, Granger causality, coherence and bispectrum analyses, PAC analysis, singular spectrum analysis, and discrete wavelet transforms with a Mayer wavelet kernel. Over 200 features were extracted from the EEG data and used as input for supervised machine learning and deep learning models across a range of classifiers. Classification analyses yielded high discriminatory performance: Sub and Dom mice were distinguished with 89% accuracy using a combination of Katz and Higuchi fractal dimension metrics with a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier. Similarly, 5xFAD and WT mice were classified with 96% accuracy using an Ensemble Boosted Trees (EBT) algorithm. Conclusion. EEG-derived features, in combination with machine learning methodologies, can identify early, preclinical electrophysiological changes associated with cognitive decline. This approach offers a promising avenue for the development of predictive diagnostic tools and may contribute to the early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Although multi-target therapies addressing inflammation, oxidative stress, and\nendothelial dysfunction have emerged, their effects on functional brain networks remain poorly characterized\ndue to limitations of conventional imaging. Objective and Innovation: This study is the first to apply high-\ndensity EEG (HD-EEG)—with millisecond temporal resolution—to assess how a novel multi-target\npharmacological intervention reshapes large-scale brain networks in CSVD. By combining electrical source\nimaging, microstate analysis, and graph-theory modeling, we aimed to capture real-time neurophysiological\nmarkers of treatment-induced plasticity. Methods: Thirty-one CSVD patients completed a 12-week regimen\ncombining agents for endothelial support, mitochondrial enhancement, oxidative stress reduction, and\nneurovascular modulation. Resting-state HD-EEG (256 channels) was recorded pre- and post-treatment.\nAnalysis focused on (1) alpha/beta oscillatory power, (2) EEG microstate dynamics, (3) default mode network\n(DMN) reorganization, and (4) global efficiency via graph theory. Key Findings: (1) Oscillatory Power: Post-\ntreatment, patients showed significantly increased alpha and beta power, especially in bilateral parietal regions,\nreflecting improved cognitive readiness. (2) Microstate Dynamics: Microstate C—associated with cognitive\ncontrol networks—exhibited longer duration and increased stability, indicating reduced neural noise and\nenhanced intrinsic brain organization. (3) DMN Reorganization: Source-level connectivity revealed increased\nactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex and reduced anterior DMN hyperconnectivity—patterns linked to\nhealthier network segregation.

Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), a non-invasive\nneuromodulatory technique that targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) and\nhas demonstrated therapeutic potential in epilepsy, depression, and cognitive disorders though\nmodulation of central nervous system function. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action of\ntaVNS in ASD remains unclear. This study investigates the therapeutic efficacy of taVNS in\nASD mouse models and elucidates its underlying neural mechanisms.

Chronic PF-DBS was applied to assess its effects on network excitability\nand tic behaviors.\nResult:\n1. δ-band (1–4 Hz) bursts in the thalamo-striatal circuit were time-locked with tic events.\n2. Tic onset was consistently preceded by transient hyperexcitability within the circuit,\nfollowed by marked post-tic suppression and slow excitability recovery.\n3. Parameterized spectral analysis revealed a paradoxical reduction in peak power within\nlow-frequency bands (1–10 Hz) alongside enhanced peak power in the 25–35 Hz range following\nbicuculline infusion, despite overall increases in broadband power.\n4. Chronic, but not acute, PF-DBS attenuated abnormal excitability in the thalamo-striatal\ncircuit and significantly reduced tic-like behaviors.\nConclusion: These findings suggest that pathological excitability fluctuations within the\nthalamo-striatal network drive tic generation in TS. Chronic PF-DBS effectively rebalanced\nnetwork activity and alleviated tic expression, highlighting its therapeutic potential. This study\nprovides mechanistic insights into tic pathophysiology and establishes a neurophysiological\nfoundation for DBS strategy optimization in TS.\nKEYWORDS: Tourette syndrome；Local field potential；Deep brain stimulation", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25062509233296.pdf"}, {"title": "Electrophysiological characteristics of dynamic changes in brain functional networks under acute and subacute high-altitude exposure", "text": "Electrophysiologicalcharacteristicsofdynamicchangesinbrain\nfunctionalnetworksunderacuteandsubacutehigh-altitude\nexposure\nTongLIU1,Jia-JiaYANG1,2,3,*, Ying-NanLIU1,2,3\n1 School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin\n300072, China\n2 Tianjin Key Laboratory of Brain Science and Neural Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin\n300072, China\n3 School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin\n300072, China\n*Correspondingauthor\nE-mail:jiajia.yang@tju.edu.cn\nAbstract：ObjectiveChronicmountaindisease(CMS)isamultisystemfunctionaldisordercaused\nbylong-termlowoxygenenvironment,butitsmechanismofbrainnetworkdynamicremodelingis\nstillunclear.Thisstudyrevealedthetemporaleffectsofacuteandsubacutehigh-altitudeexposure\nonbrainfunctionalnetworksthroughEEGanalysis.Methods Forthestudyoftheacutephase,it\nwasdividedintoalowaltitudegroup(LA)(Chongqing:400metersabovesealevel,n=51)andan\nacutephasegroup(AP)(Lhasa:3650metersabovesealevel,exposedfor7days),n=15）。Forthe\nstudyofthesubacutephase,thesamegroupofpeoplewereexposedtohighaltitudefor7and60\ndaysastheacutephasegroup(AP)(Lhasa:3650metersabovesealevel,exposedfor7days,n=35)\nandthesubacutephasegroup(SP)(Lhasa:3650metersabovesealevel,exposedfor60days),\nn=35）。 Wemeasuredphysiologicalindicatorssuchasheartrate,bloodoxygensaturation,and\nbloodpressurefortheabovesubjects,aswellastestedtheSleepQualityIndex(PSQI),\nDepressionScale(PHQ-9),andAnxietyScale(GAD-7),andcollectedEEGdataofallsubjectsin\naclosedeyerestingstate.UsingEEGenergy,lateralization,andsampleentropytoreflectchanges\ninbrainactivity.Usingdirectedtransferfunction(DTF)toconstructabrainnetwork,combining\nnodedegree,globalefficiency,andclusteringcoefficienttoquantifytopologicalproperties.\nResults Comparedtothelowaltitudegroup(LA), theacutephasegroup(AP) showedanincrease\nin sample entropy, an increase in DTF mean, a decrease in node degree, an increase in clustering\ncoefficient, and a decrease in global efficiency.

Although clinical studies have identified a variety of risk factors, no effective prevention\nhas been developed. From our previous cohort of PND patients, several single nucleotide\npolymorphism (SNP) sites on ctnna2 were identified. The current study aims to decipher the role\nand regulatory mechanism of ctnna2 in the PND model and to develop decoy\noligodeoxynucleotides (decoy) for possible prevention of PND.\nMethods: Both mice model (exploratory laparotomy+isoflurane) and neuronal model\n(TNFα+isoflurane, T+I) for PND were used. Bioinformatic research was utilized to identify\ntranscriptive active areas on ctnna2, foxo3 sequence and to predict possible trascrional factors for\nregulation. Molecular biological techniques were used to decipher the regulatory mechanism and\nspecific sites of the Sirt1-foxo3-ctnna2 axis in the development of PND. Finally, an ODNs\ntargeting the Foxo3-ctnna2 interaction was designed and tested for effectiveness in PND.\nResults: Our restuls showed that the SNP rs12472215 locates at a newly defined enhancer region\nwithin the ctnna2 intron that can be regulated by Foxo3 in human genome. The rs12472215 A>T\nmutation potentiates Foxo3’s transcriptive inhibitory effect on ctnna2. Experimental laparotomy\nin mice revealed that hippocampal Foxo3 upregulation and α-N-catenin reduction are involved in\nPND development. ChIP-PCR deciphered two regulatory sites (R1 and R2) of Foxo3 on ctnna2 in\nthe mice that are strengthened by T+I. siAscl1 abolished the rescue effect of carbenoxolone (CBX,\nFoxo3 specific inhibitor) on α-N-catenin expression in the T+I model, indicating that Foxo3\ninhibit ctnna2 transcription indirected through Ascl1. Reduction of Sirt1 increased acetyl-Foxo3,\nwhich enhanced its stability in PND. Sirt1 activation reduced acetyl-Foxo3 level and rescued α-N-\ncatenin expression in T+I stimulated neurons.

A central question that remains controversial is the mechanism by which orientation\npreference maps (OPMs)—a hallmark of cortical functional organization—emerge and develop.\nWhile molecular guidance cues are thought to play a role in the early formation of cortical maps,\nlater stages are believed to depend heavily on retinal activity patterns for refinement and\nmaturation. This study aims to investigate the developmental trajectory of OPMs by simulating\nvarious biologically plausible scenarios and identifying the key conditions that give rise to mature\nand functionally realistic orientation map layouts. Methods We employed the Topographica model,\na biologically detailed, input-driven computational framework that incorporates Hebbian learning\nmechanisms. The model was used to simulate the development of OPMs under a variety of initial\nconditions, learning parameters, and activity regimes.

As the complexity of ANN \nstructures increases, the computational complexity and resource demands of these algorithms rise \nsignificantly. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) from computational neuroscience use binary coding \nfor information transmission and processing, offering high biological plausibility and energy \nefficiency, making them a promising alternative to ANNs. Due to the threshold firing characteristic \nof SNNs, they are challenging to train. Conversion methods for SNNs can avoid direct training of \nSNNs, but object tracking algorithms based on converted SNNs often suffer from low accuracy and \nlong simulation time steps. Methods To address these issues, this paper proposes a direct training \nmethod based on gradient substitution and an attention mechanism to reduce simulation time steps \nand improve algorithm accuracy. We first process the input data through feature extraction and \nencoding modules to adapt it to the SNN. Then, using the self -attention mechanism of SNNs and \npositional encoding information, we model the internal features of the template and search region, \nallowing the model to adaptively reduce attention to irrelevant information. We then compute and \nrepresent the cross -attention of the SNN, using the SNN's cross -attention to find the matching \nposition of the template in the search image.

However, the mechanisms\nunderlying this process remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a fiber photometry system\nfor calcium imaging to monitor the activity of neurons in the external globus pallidus (GPe) and\nthe subthalamic nucleus (STN) while the mice engaged in a volitional stop-signal task, comprising\n67% GO and 33% NO GO task. Results indicated that GPe and STN neurons, which receive\nprojections from the secondary motor cortex (M2), responded to auditory cues, auditory\nfeedback, and rewards during both GO and NO GO trials. Importantly, chemogenetic\nmanipulation revealed that activating the M2-GPe pathway specifically enhanced volitional\ninhibition by modulating their response to auditory feedback within the volitional stop-signal task\nsession. However, analysis of calcium signals in GPe revealed that chemogenetic activation of\nM2-projected GPe neurons inhibited the GPe neuron’s response to the auditory feedback.

Collectively, these findings identified the M2-GPe pathway for auditory\nbiofeedback to improve volitional control, offering novel avenues for the advancement of neural\ninterfaces for biofeedback and enhancement of BCI efficacy.\nKeywords: auditory feedback, biofeedback, volitional control, volitional inhibition, BCI, secondary\nmotor cortex (M2), external globus pallidus (GPe)", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25061214134373.pdf"}, {"title": "Dynamics and Information-Processing Characteristics of a Winner-Take-All Network of 5-HT Neurons in the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus", "text": "Dynamics and Information -Processing Characteristics of a \nWinner-Take-All Network of 5-HT Neurons in the Dorsal Raphe \nNucleus \nJinning Zhang1, Yan Li*1, 2 \n \n1 Department of Exercise Physiology, Beijing Sport University, Beijing 100084, China \n2 Beijing Key Laboratory of Sports Performance and Skill Assessment , Beijing Sport University, \nBeijing 100084, China \n \n* Corresponding author \n \n E-mail: bsuliyan@bsu.edu.cn \n \nAbstract: Objective Recent research has demonstrated that 5-HT neurons within the dorsal raphe \nnucleus (DRN) exhibit recurrent inhibition and strong short-term potentiation (STP), leading to a \nwinner-take-all (WTA) phenomenon in the neural network. Specifically, neuronal subgroups \nactivated by high-frequency external inputs can suppress the activity of other subgroups following \na period of competition . This study further explored the nonlinear dynamics and information \nprocessing characteristics of the WTA n etwork, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for \nunderstanding complex brain functions predicated on WTA networks. Methods A WTA network of \n5000 5 -HT neurons in the DRN was simulated using a Leaky Integrate -and-Fire (LIF) model. \nRecurrent inhibition was mediated by the SRP synaptic model, with competitive excitatory inputs \nfrom simulated lateral habenula (LHb) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The strength of LHb inputs to \nDRN was varied to analyze hysteresis loops and bifurcation points.  The effects of scanned STP-\nrelated parameters on the hysteresis loop characteristics were evaluated. Small perturbations near \nthe critical point were applied to a nalyze critical slowing -down. Information-theoretic analysis \nquantified mutual information, redundancy, and synergy between network input and output. \nSimulations used the Python -based Brian2 package, with parameters drawn from the literature.  \nResults The network exhibited bistability at an LHb input frequency of 16 Hz , with a hysteresis \nloop width of 0.68 Hz. State transitions occurred via saddle -node bifurcations, accompanied by \ncritical slowing down. Parameter scanning revealed significant associations (p<0.001) between STP \ntime constants and hysteresis loop position. Mutual information peaked near specific parameter \nvalues. The network conveyed information mainly through redundant encoding, with weak synergy. \nConclusion The WTA network in the DRN achieves state transitions through saddle -node \nbifurcation and hysteresis, with critical slowing occurring near the bifurcation point. Information \nprocessing is enhanced by redundant encoding,  and network dynamics and information transfer \nefficiency are modulated by parameters , suggesting that modulation of STP is one of the \nmechanisms for optimizing information processing. \n \nKeywords：DRN; 5-HT Neurons; Neural Network; Nonlinear Dynamics; Neural Coding", "url": "https://www.cns.org.cn/upload/2025/25051520461172.pdf"}, {"title": "Characterization of Functional Human-Specific Regulatory Elements in Prefrontal Cortical Cells", "text": "Characterization of Functional Human-Specific Regulatory\nElements in Prefrontal Cortical Cells\nBufan Jin1,2, Langjian Zhu2,3, Huizhong Chang2, Yanrong Wei1,2, Yuanchun Tang2, Yuxuan\nZhang1,2, Xun Xu1,2,4, Lifang Wang2,4*, Lei Han2,4*\nAuthor affiliations:\n1 College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.\n2 BGI Research, Hangzhou 310012, China.\n3 School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology,\nGuangzhou, 510006, China.\n4 BGI Research, Shenzhen 518103, China.\n* Corresponding authors:\nhanlei2@genomics.cn\nwanglifang@genomics.cn\nAbstract: Objective Understanding the regulatory mechanism of gene expression driven by\nhuman-specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in adult brain remains elusive. The prefrontal\ncortex (PFC) is critically associated with higher-order cognitive functions and has undergone\nsignificant expansion during mammalian evolution. However, systematic comparative epigenetic\nstudies of the PFC across mammalian species remain lacking. Methods Using single-nucleus\ntranscriptomics/epigenomics (over 300,000 cells), we analyzed PFC regulatory programs in\nhuman, macaque, and mouse. Results (1) We show human-specific candidate CREs (cCREs),\nincluding human epigenetic-specific (HES) cCREs and human accelerated regions, play a pivotal\nrole in modulating human-specific gene expression, and human sequencing-specific cCREs are\nenriched with transposable elements such as ERVK and LINE-1 driving regulatory innovation\nduring human PFC evolution. (2) Human-gained chromatin accessibility in adult PFC shows\nneuropsychiatric relevance. (3) Machine learning identified schizophrenia (SCZ) -associated SNP\nrs76095298 in a HES cCRE, altering ETV1 binding at PITPNM2 (SCZ risk gene), potentially\nrepresenting a novel therapeutic target for SCZ.
